        "abstract": "Brain and spinal cord repair is a very difficult task in view of the extremely limited repair capability of the mature central nervous system (CNS). Thus, cellular therapies are regarded as a new frontier for both acute and chronic neurological diseases characterized by neuron or oligodendroglia degeneration. Although cell replacement has been considered as the primary goal of such approaches, in recent years greater attention has been devoted to the possibility that new undifferentiated cells in damaged nervous tissue might also act in autocrine-paracrine fashion, regulating the micro-environment through the release of growth factor and cytokines, also regulating immune response and local inflammation. In this review, repair of demyelinating disease using endogenous cells will be discussed in view of the critical role played by thyroid hormones (THs) during developmental myelination, focusing on the following points: 1) endogenous stem and precursor cells during demyelinating diseases; 2) TH homeostasis in the CNS; 3) cellular and molecular mechanism regulated by TH during developmental myelination and 4) a working hypothesis to develop a rationale for the use of THs to improve remyelination through endogenous stem and precursor cells in the course of demyelinating diseases.",

        "title": "The quest for liver progenitor cells: a practical point of view.",
        "abstract": "Many chronic liver diseases can lead to hepatic dysfunction with organ failure. At present, orthotopic liver transplantation represents the benchmark therapy of terminal liver disease. However this practice is limited by shortage of donor grafts, the need for lifelong immunosuppression and very demanding state-of-the-art surgery. For this reason, new therapies have been developed to restore liver function, primarily in the form of hepatocyte transplantation and artificial liver support devices. While already offered in very specialized centers, both of these modalities still remain experimental. Recently, liver progenitor cells have shown great promise for cell therapy, and consequently they have attracted a lot of attention as an alternative or supportive tool for liver transplantation. These liver progenitor cells are quiescent in the healthy liver and become activated in certain liver diseases in which the regenerative capacity of mature hepatocytes and/or cholangiocytes is impaired. Although reports describing liver progenitor cells are numerous, they have not led to a consensus on the identity of the liver progenitor cell. In this review, we will discuss some of the characteristics of these cells and the different ways that have been used to obtain these from rodents. We will also highlight the challenges that researchers are facing in their quest to identify and use liver progenitor cells.",

        "abstract": "Among the many cell types that may prove useful to regenerative medicine, mounting evidence suggests that human term placenta-derived cells will join the list of significant contributors. In making new cell therapy-based strategies a clinical reality, it is fundamental that no a priori claims are made regarding which cell source is preferable for a particular therapeutic application. Rather, ongoing comparisons of the potentiality and characteristics of cells from different sources should be made to promote constant improvement in cell therapies, and such comparisons will likely show that individually tailored cells can address disease-specific clinical needs. The principle underlying such an approach is resistance to the notion that comprehensive characterization of any cell type has been achieved, neither in terms of phenotype nor risks-to-benefits ratio. Tailoring cell therapy approaches to specific conditions also requires an understanding of basic disease mechanisms and close collaboration between translational researchers and clinicians, to identify current needs and shortcomings in existing treatments. To this end, the international workshop entitled \"Placenta-derived stem cells for treatment of inflammatory diseases: moving toward clinical application\" was held in Brescia, Italy, in March 2009, and aimed to harness an understanding of basic inflammatory mechanisms inherent in human diseases with updated findings regarding biological and therapeutic properties of human placenta-derived cells, with particular emphasis on their potential for treating inflammatory diseases. Finally, steps required to allow their future clinical application according to regulatory aspects including good manufacturing practice (GMP) were also considered. In September 2009, the International Placenta Stem Cell Society (IPLASS) was founded to help strengthen the research network in this field.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade, much progress has been made in developing protocols for the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into a neural phenotype. The appropriate agent for cell therapy is neural precursors (NPs). Here, we demonstrate the derivation of highly enriched and expandable populations of proliferating NPs from the CCTL14 line of hESCs. These NPs could differentiate in vitro into functionally active neurons, as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and electrophysiological analysis. Neural cells differentiated in vitro from hESCs exhibit broad cellular heterogeneity with respect to developmental stage and lineage specification. To analyze the population of the derived NPs, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and characterized the expression of several pluripotent and neural markers, such as Nanog, SSEA-4, SSEA-1, TRA-1-60, CD24, CD133, CD56 (NCAM), beta-III-tubulin, NF70, nestin, CD271 (NGFR), CD29, CD73, and CD105 during long-term propagation. The analyzed cells were used for transplantation into the injured rodent brain; the tumorigenicity of the transplanted cells was apparently eliminated following long-term culture. These results complete the characterization of the CCTL14 line of hESCs and provide a framework for developing cell selection strategies for neural cell-based therapies.",

As the endogenous protective function of adult cardiomyocytes is limited, nonmyocytic cells may be activated to protect myocardium from ischemic injury. In this investigation, we demonstrated in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia that the liver was able to respond to myocardial ischemia to upregulate a number of genes encoding secreted proteins, mobilize its cells, and release cell contents into the circulatory system. These naturally occurring mechanisms suggested a possible cardioprotective role for myocardial ischemia-conditioned liver cells and inspired us to develop cardioprotective therapies based on these mechanisms. We demonstrated that administration of liver cell extract derived from myocardial ischemic mice, but not sham control mice, resulted in a significant reduction in acute myocardial infarction as well as the density of TUNEL+ cells in ischemic myocardium compared to administration of PBS at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hrs. These observations suggest that liver cells may respond to myocardial ischemia to express cardioprotective factors, which may be identified and used for alleviating myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "Effective dopamine (DA) neuron differentiation from neural precursor cells (NPCs) is prerequisite for precursor/stem cell-based therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor, has been reported as a transcription factor that can drive DA neuron differentiation from non-dopaminergic NPCs in vitro. However, Nurr1 alone neither induces full neuronal maturation nor expression of proteins found specifically in midbrain DA neurons. In addition, Nurr1 expression is inefficient in inducing DA phenotype expression in NPCs derived from certain species such as mouse and human. We show here that Foxa2, a forkhead transcription factor whose role in midbrain DA neuron development was recently revealed, synergistically cooperates with Nurr1 to induce DA phenotype acquisition, midbrain-specific gene expression, and neuronal maturation. Thus, the combinatorial expression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in NPCs efficiently yielded fully differentiated nigral (A9)-type midbrain neurons with clearly detectable DA neuronal activities. The effects of Foxa2 in DA neuron generation were observed regardless of the brain regions or species from which NPCs were derived. Furthermore, DA neurons generated by ectopic Foxa2 expression were more resistant to toxins. Importantly, Foxa2 expression resulted in a rapid cell cycle exit and reduced cell proliferation. Consistently, transplantation of NPCs transduced with Nurr1 and Foxa2 generated grafts enriched with midbrain-type DA neurons but reduced number of proliferating cells, and significantly reversed motor deficits in a rat PD model. Our findings can be applied to ongoing attempts to develop an efficient and safe precursor/stem cell-based therapy for PD.",

        "abstract": "There are many challenges associated with characterizing and quantifying cells for use in cell- and tissue-based therapies. From a regulatory perspective, these advanced treatments must not only be safe and effective but also be made by high-quality manufacturing processes that allow for on-time delivery of viable products. Although sterility assays can be adapted from conventional bioprocessing, cell- and tissue-based therapies require more stringent safety assessments, especially in relation to use of animal products, immune reaction, and potential instability due to extended culture times. Furthermore, cell manufacturers who plan to use human embryonic stem cells in their therapies need to be particularly stringent in their final purification steps, due to the unrestricted growth potential of these cells. This review summarizes the current issues in characterization and quantification for cell- and tissue-based therapies, dividing these challenges into the regulatory themes of safety, potency, and manufacturing quality. It outlines current assays in use, as well as highlights the limits of many of these product release tests. Mode of action is discussed, with particular reference to in vitro surrogate assays that can be used to provide information to correlate with proposed in vivo patient efficacy. Importantly, this review highlights the requirement for basic research to improve current knowledge on the in vivo fate of these treatments; as well as an improved stakeholder negotiation process to identify the measurement requirements that will ensure the manufacture of the best possible cell- and tissue-based therapies within the shortest timeframe for the most patient benefit.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cells capture and process antigen and present it to T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs. Dendritic cells of the skin, including epidermal Langerhans cells, langerin(+) and langerin(negative) dermal dendritic cells are ideally positioned to take up pathogens that enter the body through the skin or vaccines that are administered into (intradermal) or onto (epicutaneous) the skin. The antigen uptake properties of skin dendritic cells have not thoroughly been studied yet. We therefore investigated the uptake of the fluorochrome-conjugated model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) by skin dendritic cells in the mouse. OVA was readily taken up by immature Langerhans cells both in situ and in cell suspensions. When offered to Langerhans cells in situ either by \"bathing\" skin explants in OVA-containing culture medium or by intradermal injection they retained the captured OVA for at least 2-3 days when migrating into the culture medium and, importantly, into the draining lymph nodes. Also langerin(+) and - to a larger extent - langerin(negative) skin dendritic cells took up and transported OVA to the lymph nodes. Interestingly, mature Langerhans cells were still capable of ingesting substantial amounts of OVA, indicating that predominantly receptor-mediated endocytosis is operative in these cells. Unlike macropinocytosis, this pathway of endocytosis is not shut down upon dendritic cell maturation. These observations indicate that in intradermal vaccination schemes, Langerhans cells from the epidermis are prominently involved. They were recently shown to possess the capacity to induce functional cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the potential to markedly enhance antigen uptake and processing by targeting antigen to c-type lectin receptors on Langerhans cells was also recently demonstrated. Our data provide a rationale and an incentive to explore in more detail antigen targeting to Langerhans cells with the aim of harnessing it for immunotherapy.",

It is an X-linked recessive disease caused by a defective dystrophin gene. The disease is characterized by progressive limb weakness, respiratory and cardiac failure, and premature death. Fibrosis is a prominent pathological feature of muscle biopsies from patients with DMD. It directly causes muscle dysfunction and contributes to the lethal DMD phenotype. Although gene therapy and cell therapy may ultimately provide a cure for DMD, currently the disease is devastating, with no effective therapies. Recent studies have demonstrated that ameliorating muscle fibrosis may represent a viable therapeutic approach for DMD. By reducing scar formation, antifibrotic therapies may not only improve muscle function but also enhance muscle regeneration and promote gene and stem cell engraftment. Antifibrotic therapy may serve as a necessary addition to gene and cell therapies to treat DMD in the future. Therefore, understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying muscle fibrogenesis associated with dystrophin deficiency is key to the development of effective antifibrotic therapies for DMD.",

However, whether fibrin gel can induce differentiation of neural progenitor cells of spinal cord into motoneurons remains to be elucidated. In this study, we prepared a fibrin-based hybrid gel incorporated with laminin and fibronectin using rat fresh plasma as a crosslinking agent. The physical properties of this hybrid gel were examined with electron microscope, as well as its degradation and vascularization after subcutaneous transplantation with histological methods. Immunofluorescence stainings were used to study the proliferation and differentiation of the neural progenitor cells seeded in this 3D hybrid gel. The results indicate that such a hybrid gel possesses the unique physical characteristics, and the ability to promote both the proliferation and differentiation of the neural progenitor cells into neuron, including ChAT-positive motoneuron. Thus, it is suggested that this hybrid gel might be suitable for a mimetic tissue transplant for central nerve system injury, such as injured spinal cord repair.",

        "abstract": "Intra-patient variability is a key challenge in cancer treatment. This makes it necessary to find the factors affecting tumor growth and accordingly schedule therapies over the treatment horizon for the patient. In this work, model-based studies are performed to investigate these issues for optimal immunotherapeutic intervention. Dendritic cell therapy is a targeted immunotherapy where the dendritic cells and its activating agents such as interleukin are engineered, stimulated to recognize and specifically eradicate tumors. A mathematical model that integrates tumor dynamics and dendritic cell therapy is used to perform the analysis. Global sensitivity analysis of the model is done using high dimensional model reduction (HDMR) technique and the key parameters altering the tumor growth are identified. The variations in these key parameters are deemed to result in intra-patient variability during the treatment phase. Then, reactive scheduling is used to schedule dendritic cell interventions with and without interleukin interventions under the varying conditions of the patient. Moreover, the key parameters obtained from HDMR are verified using the reactive scheduling and nominal scheduling approaches. Besides saving costs, the in silico analysis done in this paper may be useful to the oncology community in designing experiments to clinically measure the influential parameters. It can also be used as a decision making tool to determine the required intervention dosage during the treatment.",

        "abstract": "Although cellular transplantation has been shown to promote improvements in cardiac function following injury, poor cell survival following transplantation continues to limit the efficacy of this therapy. We have previously observed that transplantation of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) improves cardiac function in an acute murine model of myocardial infarction to a greater extent than myoblasts. This improved regenerative capacity of MDSCs is linked to their increased level of antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase. In the current study, we demonstrated the pivotal role of antioxidant levels on MDSCs survival and cardiac functional recovery by either reducing the antioxidant levels with diethyl maleate or increasing antioxidant levels with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Both the anti- and pro-oxidant treatments dramatically influenced the survival of the MDSCs in vitro. When NAC-treated MDSCs were transplanted into infarcted myocardium, we observed significantly improved cardiac function, decreased scar tissue formation, and increased numbers of CD31(+) endothelial cell structures, compared to the injection of untreated and diethyl maleate-treated cells. These results indicate that elevating the levels of antioxidants in MDSCs with NAC can significantly influence their tissue regeneration capacity.",

There are currently no cures or efficacious treatments for these diseases. In recent years, significant developments in stem cell research have been applied to MNDs, particularly regarding neuroprotection and cell replacement. However, a consistent source of motor neurons for cell replacement is required. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could provide an inexhaustible supply of differentiated cell types, including motor neurons that could be used for MND therapies. Recently, it has been demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells may serve as an alternative source of motor neurons, since they share ES characteristics, self-renewal, and the potential to differentiate into any somatic cell type. In this review, we discuss several reproducible methods by which hESCs or iPS cells are efficiently isolated and differentiated into functional motor neurons, and possible clinical applications.",

C57BL/6 mice were assigned to two groups. In OVA, mice were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with ovalbumin. Control mice (C) received saline under the same protocol. C and OVA were further randomized to receive BMDMC (2 \u8133 10\u9226? or saline intravenously 24 h before the first challenge. BMDMC therapy reduced eosinophil infiltration, smooth muscle-specific actin expression, subepithelial fibrosis, and myocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, thus causing a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness and lung mechanical parameters. BMDMC from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice transplanted into GFP-negative mice yielded lower engraftment in OVA. BMDMC increased insulin-like growth factor expression, but reduced interleukin-5, transforming growth factor-\u5c3e, platelet-derived growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression. In conclusion, in the present chronic allergic inflammation model, BMDMC therapy was an effective pre-treatment protocol that potentiated airway epithelial cell repair and prevented inflammatory and remodeling processes.",

Tumours are composed of both malignant and benign cells.

The fact that these mechanisms have been elucidated is very important for the design of therapeutic options aiming at controlling and ameliorating tissue damage, thus delaying and, in some instances, completely stopping progression to end-stage renal disease, and facilitating repair. The ability of the body to maintain renal homeostasis indicates that a reservoir of cells should exist somewhere in the body to support normal turnover of glomerular cells but insufficient to adequately repair the damage in major glomerular damage. Although tubular cells can repopulate damaged tubules spontaneously after major injury, that is not the case with glomerular cells. Chronic progressive renal disease is characterized by glomerulosclerosis, interstitial inflammation, tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis. If the adaptive capacity of the cells present in a particular renal compartment is exceeded, the injurious agent/reaction produces irreversible damage leading to cell death which may be by apoptosis or necrosis. Lost cells need to be restored and the extracellular matrix scaffold must be remodeled to its original form. This chapter will recapitulate what is known about glomerular healing and repair. The field is evolving and changing rapidly.",

Since this time, the field of bone gene therapy has tackled many issues surrounding safety and efficacy of this type of strategy. We present studies examining the parameters of the timing of bone healing, and remodeling when heterotopic ossification (HO) is used for bone fracture repair using an adenovirus gene therapy approach. We use a rat fibula defect, which surprisingly does not heal even when a simple fracture is introduced. In this model, the bone quickly resorbs most likely due to the non-weight bearing nature of this bone in rodents. Using our gene therapy system robust HO can be introduced at the targeted location of the defect resulting in bone repair. The HO and resultant bone healing appeared to be dose dependent, based on the number of AdBMP2-transduced cells delivered. Interestingly, the HO undergoes substantial remodeling, and assumes the size and shape of the missing segment of bone. However, in some instances we observed some additional bone associated with the repair, signifying that perhaps the forces on the newly forming bone are inadequate to dictate shape. In all cases, the HO appeared to fuse into the adjacent long bone. The data collectively indicates that the use of BMP2 gene therapy strategies may vary depending on the location and nature of the defect. Therefore, additional parameters should be considered when implementing such strategies.",

Here, we developed an acellular, nanofiber-based preparation of self-assembled peptides to deliver the secretome of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using an integrated in vitro and in vivo approach, we found that nanofibers preconditioned with ESCs could reverse cell hyperpermeability and apoptosis in vitro and protect against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute kidney injury in vivo. The renoprotective effect of preconditioned nanofibers associated with an attenuation of Rho kinase activation. We also observed that the combined presence of follistatin, adiponectin, and secretory leukoprotease during preconditioning was essential to the renoprotective properties of the nanofibers. In summary, we developed a designer-peptide nanofiber that can serve as a delivery platform for the beneficial effects of stem cells without the problems of teratoma formation or limited cell engraftment and viability.",

Cell fusion has been shown to be implicated in regeneration, and the complementation of recessive mutations affecting the liver, brain, muscle, lung and gut, under appropriate conditions. However, we should be cautious and better understand the mechanisms that govern cell fusion during regeneration before to consider it as clinically relevant. In this chapter, we will present the current evidences about the role of cell fusion in tissue regeneration and its future potential as therapy.

Over the past decade, international research efforts have established a wealth of basic science and preclinical evidence regarding the differentiation potential and regenerative properties of both freshly processed, heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction cells and culture expanded, relatively homogeneous adipose-derived stromal/stem cells. The stage has been set for clinicians to translate adipose-derived cells from the bench to the bedside; however, this process will involve \"development\" steps that fall outside of traditional \"hypothesis-driven, mechanism-based\" paradigm. This concise review examines the next stages of the development process for therapeutic applications of adipose-derived cells and highlights the current state of the art regarding clinical trials. It is recommended that the experiments addressing these issues be reported comprehensively in the peer-review literature. This transparency will accelerate the standardization and reproducibility of adipose-derived cell therapies with respect to their efficacy and safety.",

Current therapies are applicable to late-stage disease and carry significant side effects, whereas cell-based therapy may provide an alternative by repairing areas of vasodegeneration and reversing ischemia. However, EPCs from diabetic patients with vascular complications are dysfunctional. Moreover, the diabetic environment poses its own challenges and complicates the use of autologous EPCs. Before EPCs become the ideal \"cell therapy,\" the optimal EPC must be determined, any functional dysfunction must be corrected prior to use, and the diabetic milieu will require modification to accept the EPCs.

However, their differentiation potential in humans is yet unknown. We isolated M\u7709ller glia from adult human retinas and propagated them in vitro revealing for the first time their ability to differentiate into rod photoreceptors. These results were also confirmed with mice retinas. Here, we describe conditions by which human MGCs adopt a rod photoreceptor commitment with a surprising efficiency as high as 54%. Functional characterization of M\u7709ller glia-derived photoreceptors by patch-clamp recordings revealed that their electrical properties are comparable to those of adult rods. Interestingly, our procedure allowed efficient derivation of MGC cultures starting from both injured and degenerating and postmortem human retinas. Human transplanted M\u7709ller glia-derived photoreceptors integrate and survive within immunodeficient mouse retinas. These data provide evidence that M\u7709ller glia retains an unpredicted plasticity and multipotent potential into adulthood, and it is therefore a promising source of novel therapeutic applications in retinal repair.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of clinical transplant tolerance has led to enhanced understanding of mechanisms underlying immune regulation, including the characterization of immune regulatory cells, in particular antigen-presenting cells (APC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), that may play key roles in promoting operational tolerance. Dendritic cells (DC) are highly efficient APC that have been studied extensively in rodents and humans, and more recently in non-human primates. Owing to their ability to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, DC are considered to play crucial roles in directing the alloimmune response towards transplant tolerance or rejection. Mechanisms via which they can promote central and peripheral tolerance include clonal deletion, the induction of Treg, and inhibition of memory T cell responses. These properties have led to the use of tolerogenic DC as a therapeutic strategy to promote organ transplant tolerance. In rodents, infusion of donor- or recipient-derived tolerogenic DC can extensively prolong donor-specific allograft survival, in association with regulation of the host T cell response. In clinical transplantation, progress has been made in monitoring DC in relation to graft outcome, including studies in operational liver transplant tolerance. Although clinical trials involving immunotherapeutic DC for patients with cancer are ongoing, implementation of human DC therapy in clinical transplantation will require assessment of various critical issues. These include cell isolation and purification techniques, source, route and timing of administration, and combination immunosuppressive therapy. With ongoing non-human primate studies focused on DC therapy, these logistics can be investigated seeking the optimal approaches. The scientific rationale for implementation of tolerogenic DC therapy to promote clinical transplant tolerance is strong. Evaluation of technical and therapeutic logistic issues is an important next step prior to the application of tolerogenic DC in clinical organ transplantation.",

        "abstract": "In 1938, the field of Transfusion Medicine began as the simpler entity - Blood Banking. It was a discipline that focused on collecting, processing, storing and distributing end stage blood cells, plasma and plasma fractions to patients. Over the years, the field progressed to include clinical patient services such as apheresis technology and with the development of stem cell transplantation as a standard of care, Cell Therapy. Now the discipline is also finding a niche in the area of Regenerative Medicine. The role played by Transfusion Medicine practitioners in Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine was predicated on many factors: (1) pre-existing, established protocols for therapeutic leukapheresis, (2) prior experience with mononuclear cell collection and processing, (3) long term familiarity with, and a clear understanding of, cGMP and cGLP guidelines, Federal regulations, and the voluntary standards established by various organizations, (4) close relationships with practitioners in clinical departments of medicine, pediatrics, oncology, surgery, and their subspecialty areas. While the initial Cell Therapy programs related primarily to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as Regenerative Medicine programs developed, transfusion specialists found it to be a related field that would also benefit from their input. Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, now provide fertile soil for the seeds of Transfusion Medicine to grow. The once narrowly defined field of Blood Banking now encompasses involvement in major new Cellular Therapy/Regenerative Medicine research protocols related to treatment of patients with cancer as well as renal, hepatic and cardiac illnesses. This in turn provides opportunities for residents and fellows to consider robust careers in the field of Transfusion Medicine. In this manner we will move forward with one eye on the past and another on the promising future.",

        "abstract": "Through a mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi), small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules can target complementary mRNA strands for degradation, thus specifically inhibiting gene expression. The ability of siRNAs to inhibit gene expression offers a mechanism that can be exploited for novel therapeutics. Indeed, over the past decade, at least 21 siRNA therapeutics have been developed for more than a dozen diseases, including various cancers, viruses, and genetic disorders. Like other biological drugs, RNAi-based therapeutics often require a delivery vehicle to transport them to the targeted cells. Thus, the clinical advancement of numerous siRNA drugs has relied on the development of siRNA carriers, including biodegradable nanoparticles, lipids, bacteria, and attenuated viruses. Most therapies permit systemic delivery of the siRNA drug, while others use ex vivo delivery by autologous cell therapy. Advancements in bioengineering and nanotechnology have led to improved control of delivery and release of some siRNA therapeutics. Likewise, progress in molecular biology has allowed for improved design of the siRNA molecules. Here, we provide an overview of siRNA therapeutics in clinical trials, including their clinical progress, the challenges they have encountered, and the future they hold in the treatment of human diseases.",

        "abstract": "Differentiation of human hepatic progenitor cells to functional hepatocytes holds great potential to develop new therapeutic strategies for liver disease and to provide a platform for drug toxicity screens and identification of novel pharmaceuticals. We report here that human fetal hepatic progenitor cells (hFHPCs) efficiently differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells by continuous exposure to a combination of soluble factors for 7 days in vitro. We compared the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), oncostatin M (OSM), dexamethasone (DEX), or a combination on the expression of a liver-specific marker, albumin (ALB). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that, upon exposure to a combination of OSM, DEX, and HGF, the expression of ALB gradually increased in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the level of the hepatic progenitor cell marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) decreased as differentiation progressed. Moreover, cells exposed to the combination of OSM, DEX, and HGF gradually featured highly differentiated hepatic functions, including ALB secretion, glycogen storage, urea production, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity. The effect of these factors on the differentiation of hFHPCs may be blocked by U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a combination of soluble factors facilitates the efficient generation of highly differentiated hepatocyte-like cells from hFHPCs and ERK1/2 signaling pathway involved in this process. Results suggest that this system will be useful for generating functional hepatocytes and, hence, may serve as a cell source suitable for preclinical pharmacological research and testing.",

The strategy of isolation and characterization of neural stem cells from various sources will probably provide a major impetus and open up an interesting, novel therapeutic modality for several neurodegenerative disorders.

To shed light on the mechanism of immunoregulation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), we investigated the effects of allogeneic ADSCs on the Th17 lymphocytes of patients with active SLE by co-culturing ADSCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients in vitro. The results indicated that ADSCs from passage 3 (P3) down-regulated the proportion of Th17 cells and their abilities to produce IL-17, whereas ADSCs from passage 8 (P8) had contrasting effect. The results also showed cell-cell contact played a role in P3 down-regulation. Blocking the functional pathway of IL-23 (both its ligand and its receptor) also contributed to this suppression. These results suggested that immunomodulation of ADSCs may be achieved by partially suppressing the number and capability of Th17 lymphocytes, indicating that ADSCs could be employed as therapeutic tools for the autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells are defined by their capacity for both self-renewal and directed differentiation; thus, they represent great promise for regenerative medicine. Historically, stem cells have been categorized as either embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or adult stem cells (ASCs). It was previously believed that only ESCs hold the ability to differentiate into any cell type, whereas ASCs have the capacity to give rise only to cells of a given germ layer. More recently, however, numerous studies demonstrated the ability of ASCs to differentiate into cell types beyond their tissue origin. The aim of this review was to summarize contemporary evidence regarding stem cell availability, differentiation, and more specifically, the potential of these cells in the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in both animal models and human research. We performed a search on PubMed for articles related to definition, localisation and circulation of stem cells as well as the application of stem cells in both diagnosis and treatment of ED. Strong evidence supports the concept that stem cell therapy is potentially the next therapeutic approach for ED. To date, a large spectrum of stem cells, including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, adipose tissue-derived stem cells and muscle-derived stem cells, have been investigated for neural, vascular, endothelial or smooth muscle regeneration in animal models for ED. In addition, several subtypes of ASCs are localized in the penis, and circulating endogenous stem cells can be employed to predict the outcome of ED and ED-related cardiovascular diseases.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells with potential as novel therapies in regenerative medicine owing to the absence of allogenic rejection. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) acts as a morphogen in kidney development. The therapeutic effectiveness of bone marrow MSCs overexpressing GDNF (GDNF-MSCs) was evaluated in an NSN rat model. An adenoviral vector was used to transduce MSCs with GDNF and a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Then, GDNF-MSCs were injected into NSN rats via the renal artery. The influence of GDNF on renal injury was assessed. The location of GDNF-MSCs in kidneys was detected using fluorescence microscopy, cells were counted, and kidney function was measured. Infusion of GNDF-MSCs enhanced the recovery of renal function in NSN rats. MSCs were detected in the kidney cortex after injection. Compared with control MSCs, GDNF-MSCs led to significantly better renal function and injury recovery in NSN rats. GDNF has a positive effect on MSC differentiation in renal tissue. Owing to their highly renoprotective capacity, GDNF-MSCs represent a possible novel cell-based paradigm for treatment of glomerulonephritis.",

At the same time, the progressive aging of the population has highlighted the importance of discovering therapeutic alternatives for diseases of high incidence and disability, such as stroke. Menstrual blood is a recently discovered source of stem cells with potential relevance for the treatment of stroke. Migration to the infarct site, modulation of the inflammatory reaction, secretion of neurotrophic factors, and possible differentiation warrant these cells as therapeutic tools. We here propose the use of autologous menstrual blood cells in the restorative treatment of the subacute phase of stroke. We highlight the availability, proliferative capacity, pluripotency, and angiogenic features of these cells and explore their mechanistic pathways of repair. Practical aspects of clinical application of menstrual blood cells for stroke will be discussed, from cell harvesting and cryopreservation to administration to the patient.",

However, none of these methods is able to fully restore normal striated sphincter muscle function. In this study, we explored the possibility of achieving functional recovery of the urinary sphincter muscle using autologous muscle precursor cells (MPCs) as an injectable, cell-based therapy. A canine model of striated urinary sphincter insufficiency was created by microsurgically removing part of the sphincter muscle in 24 dogs. Autologous MPCs were obtained, expanded in culture, and injected into the damaged sphincter muscles of 12 animals. The animals were followed for up to 6 months after injection, and urodynamic studies, functional organ bath studies, ultrastructural and histological examinations were performed. Animals receiving MPC injections demonstrated sphincter pressures of approximately 80% of normal values, while the pressures in the control animals without cells dropped and remained at 20% of normal values. Histological analysis indicated that the implanted cells survived and formed tissue, including new innervated muscle fibers, within the injected region of the sphincter. These results indicate that autologous muscle precursor cells may be able to restore otherwise irreversibly damaged urinary sphincter function clinically.",

Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) is a rare and debilitating neurologic disease of insidious onset, characterized by atrophy of the cerebellum pons and inferior olivary nuclei with concomitant ambulation deficits and dyscoordination. Here, we report the generation of iPS cells from skin fibroblasts of a 56-year-old female patient with familial OPCA. OPCA is classified in the autosomal dominant ataxia that is also named spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 7. The disease allele of SCA7 gene of the patient contains 45 CAG trinucleotide repeats, the number of which is larger than the normal repeat number (4 to 36 CAG repeats). The OPCA-iPS cells were generated via ectopic expression of four transcription factors: OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. The OPCA-iPS cells expressed the pluripotency markers, and they can be differentiated into various somatic cell types in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the iPS cells also can be committed to differentiate into neural cells. Therefore, the OPCA-iPS cells offer an unprecedented cell model to investigate disease mechanisms, discover novel drugs, and develop new therapies for OPCA.",

Therapies designed to administer HIV-resistant stem cells to an infected patient may also provide a functional cure, as observed in a bone marrow transplant performed with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) homozygous for the CCR5-\u879632-bp allele. In our current studies, preclinical evaluation of a combination anti-HIV lentiviral vector was performed, in vivo, in humanized NOD-RAG1(-/-) IL2r\u7eac(-/-) knockout mice. This combination vector, which displays strong preintegration inhibition of HIV-1 infection in vitro, contains a human/rhesus macaque TRIM5\u4f2a isoform, a CCR5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and a TAR decoy. Multilineage hematopoiesis from anti-HIV lentiviral vector-transduced human CD34(+) HSCs was observed in the peripheral blood and in various lymphoid organs, including the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, of engrafted mice. Anti-HIV vector-transduced CD34(+) cells displayed normal development of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. The anti-HIV vector-transduced cells also displayed knockdown of cell surface CCR5 due to the expression of the CCR5 shRNA. After in vivo challenge with either an R5-tropic BaL-1 or X4-tropic NL4-3 strain of HIV-1, maintenance of human CD4(+) cell levels and a selective survival advantage of anti-HIV gene-modified cells were observed in engrafted mice. The data provided from our study confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination anti-HIV lentiviral vector in a hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy setting for HIV and validates its potential application in future clinical trials.",

The last 2 decades have seen impressive results in its application against haemato-oncologic malignancies, melanomas and prostate carcinoma. Cellular immunotherapy has since found applicability beyond cancer into autoimmunity and continues to expand in its clinical applicability. The discovery that stem cells have the ability to differentiate into more mature cell types, like neurones and myocardium, has focused research on using exogenous cells to repair damaged tissues. This led to numerous clinical trials using stem cells in myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and spinal cord damage. Results have ranged from modest to significant clinical outcomes with continuing debate on the exact process of regeneration achieved. The intertwining between cell therapy and transfusion medicine now includes research on progenitor cells for the production of mature red cells. It is also clear that cell therapy has enabled an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of many diseases, while perhaps its role in regenerative medicine is most enticing. However, the critical role of manufacturing in terms of cost, complexity, reproducibility, and regulatory matters remains a central issue in the consideration of whether cell therapy has met all of its promise.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells are self-renewable cells with the differentiation capacity to develop into somatic cells with biological functions. This ability to sustain a renewable source of multi- and/or pluripotential differentiation has brought new hope to the field of regenerative medicine in terms of cell therapy and tissue engineering. Moreover, stem cells are invaluable tools as in vitro models for studying diverse fields, from basic scientific questions such as developmental processes and lineage commitment, to practical application including drug screening and testing. The stem cells with widest differentiation potential are pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which are rare cells with the ability to generate somatic cells from all three germ layers. PSCs are considered the most optimal choice for therapeutic potential of stem cells, bringing new impetus to the field of regenerative medicine. In this article, we discuss the therapeutic potential of human PSCs (hPSCs) including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), reviewing the current preclinical and clinical data using these stem cells. We describe the classification of different sources of hPSCs, ongoing research, and currently encountered clinical obstacles of these novel and versatile human stem cells.",

        "abstract": "Although several studies have demonstrated a functional recovery of infarcted myocardial tissue after cell therapy, little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind it. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of cell therapy at the molecular level to screen for novel target candidates for future therapy of infarcted myocardial tissue. We used a swine acute myocardial infarction model evoked by transient occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs) or saline were injected intramyocardially or into the circumflex coronary artery. Samples for protein and RNA analysis were collected from the infarction area and healthy myocardium after a 3 week recovery period and analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Proteomic screening detected 13 protein spots which were altered after infarction but had been restored by BMMC treatment. The identification of seven proteins by mass spectrometry revealed that five proteins with decreased expression after infarction corresponded to mitochondrial proteins involved in energy metabolism. Their restored levels after BMMC treatment indicate their involvement in the recovery of heart function. In contrast, the elevated levels of \u4f2a-crystallin B chain and cathepsin D after infarction suggest an involvement in the pathological mechanisms causing a decreased heart function. This study reveals that cell therapy with BMMCs after myocardial infarction causes restoration of several altered protein levels after 3 weeks and identifies potential marker proteins involved in the pathology of infarction.",

        "abstract": "Cell based treatments for myocardial infarction have demonstrated efficacy in the laboratory and in phase I clinical trials, but the understanding of such therapies remains incomplete. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are classically defined as maintaining the ability to generate mesenchyme-derived cell types, namely adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Recent evidence suggests these cells may in fact harbor much greater potency than originally realized, as several groups have found that MSCs can form cardiac lineage cells in vitro. Additionally, experimental coculture of MSCs with cardiomyocytes appears to improve contractile function of the latter. Bolstered by such findings, several clinical trials have begun to test MSC transplantation for improving post-infarct cardiac function in human patients. The results of these trials have been mixed, underscoring the need to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying stem cell biology. To help synthesize the breadth of studies on the topic, this paper discusses current challenges in the field of MSC cellular therapies for cardiac repair, including methods of cell delivery and the identification of molecular markers that accurately specify the therapeutically relevant mesenchymal cell types. The various possible mechanisms of MSC mediated cardiac improvement, including somatic reprogramming, transdifferentiation, paracrine signaling, and direct electrophysiological coupling are also reviewed. Finally, we consider the traditional cell culture microenvironment, and the promise of cardiac tissue engineering to provide biomimetic in vitro model systems to more faithfully investigate MSC biology, helping to safely and effectively translate exciting discoveries in the laboratory to meaningful therapies in the clinic.",

Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that IGF-1 considerably enhances the myogenesis of human umbilical cord (UC) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in vitro and that IGF-1 enhances interaction and restoration of dystrophin expression in co-cultures of MSCs and muscle cells from Duchenne patients. In vivo studies showed that human MSCs were able to reach the skeletal muscle of LAMA2(dy/2j) dystrophic mice, through systemic delivery, without immunosuppression. Moreover, we showed, for the first time, that IGF-1 injected systemically together with MSCs markedly reduced muscle inflammation and fibrosis, and significantly improved muscle strength in dystrophic mice. Our results suggest that a combined treatment with IGF-1 and MSCs enhances efficiency of muscle repair and, therefore, should be further considered as a potential therapeutic approach in muscular dystrophies.",

Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) were isolated from amnion tissue by mechanical mincing and enzymatic digestion. After primary culture, the phenotype of the cells was identified by flow cytometry (FCM) and immunocytochemical staining. hAECs were co-cultured with submandibular gland acinar cells of SD rats using a double-chamber system. The expression of \u4f2a-amylase was determined by immunocytochemical method and fluorescent real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after induction for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. Digestion with trypsin is an effective method for isolating hAECs from amnion tissue. These cells were positive for CD29 and CK19 and weakly positive for CD44 and \u4f2a-amylase. Within 2 weeks, \u4f2a-amylase in hAECs increased with induction time. The expression of \u4f2a-amylase in hAECs was increased 3.38-fold after co-culturing for 1 week. This ratio increased to 6.6-fold, and these cells were positive for mucins, after co-culturing for 2 weeks. hAECs possess the potential to differentiate into ACs in vitro.

Discovery of rare subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has created a new focus in cancer research.

CSCs mimic normal adult stem cells by demonstrating unique characteristics of self-renewal and pluripotency, and the critical role for tumor growth and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. We found that CD13 was a surface marker for CSCs in human liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples, and that CD13+ CSCs were associated with a hypoxic marker in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) sample, suggesting that CD13+ CSCs have the critical role in tumor growth and resistance to anti-cancer therapy in liver cancers.

        "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have recently been employed in cell-based therapy (CBT) to promote neovascularization and regeneration of ischemic organs, such as heart and limbs. Furthermore, EPCs may be recruited from bone marrow by growing tumors to drive the angiogenic switch through physical engrafting into the lumen of nascent vessels or paracrine release of pro-angiogenic factors. CBT is hampered by the paucity of EPCs harvested from peripheral blood and suffered from several pitfalls, including the differentiation outcome of transplanted cells and low percentage of engrafted cells. Therefore, CBT will benefit from a better understanding of the signal transduction pathway(s) which govern(s) EPC homing, proliferation and incorporation into injured tissues. At the same time, this information might outline alternative molecular targets to combat tumoral neovascularization. We have recently found that store-operated Ca(2+) entry, a Ca(2+)-permeable membrane pathway that is activated upon depletion of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) pool, is recruited by vascular endothelial growth factor to support proliferation and tubulogenesis in human circulating endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). ECFCs are a subgroup of EPCs that circulate in the peripheral blood of adult individuals and are able to proliferate and differentiate into endothelial cells and form capillary networks in vitro and contribute to neovessel formation in vivo. The present review will discuss the relevance of SOCE to ECFC-based cell therapy and will address the pharmacological inhibition of store-dependent Ca(2+) channels as a promising target for anti-angiogenic treatments.",

        "abstract": "Support structures for dermal regeneration are composed of biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers, animal skin or tendons, or are bacteria products. The use of such materials is controversial due to their low efficiency. An important area within tissue engineering is the application of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to reparative surgery. The combined use of biodegradable membranes with stem cell therapy may lead to promising results for patients undergoing unsuccessful conventional treatments. Thus, the aim of this study was to test the efficacy of using membranes composed of anionic collagen with or without the addition of hyaluronic acid (HA) as a substrate for adhesion and in vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived canine MSCs. The benefit of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the differentiation of cells in culture was also tested. MSCs were collected from dog bone marrow, isolated and grown on collagen scaffolds with or without HA. Cell viability, proliferation rate, and cellular toxicity were analyzed after 7 days. The cultured cells showed uniform growth and morphological characteristics of undifferentiated MSCs, which demonstrated that MSCs successfully adapted to the culture conditions established by collagen scaffolds with or without HA. This demonstrates that such scaffolds are promising for applications to tissue regeneration. bFGF significantly increased the proliferative rate of MSCs by 63% when compared to groups without the addition of the growth factor. However, the addition of bFGF becomes limiting, since it has an inhibitory effect at high concentrations in culture medium.",

        "title": "Intelligent bioengineering in vitiligo treatment: transdermal protein transduction of melanocyte-lineage-specific genes.",
        "abstract": "Vitiligo is a common, incurable skin disease with a prevalence of about 1%. Although many vitiligo therapies are available in clinics, there is almost no one method that causes significant improvement in all vitiligo patients. Some have hypothesized that melanocyte dysfunction or deficiency underlies the loss of skin pigmentation observed in vitiligo. The autoimmune-mediated apoptosis of melanocytes might be an important part of the etiology of vitiligo, which prevents the formation of melanocytes in the skin. Here we propose a novel hypothesis for vitiligo treatment using in situ melanocyte regeneration induced by melanocyte-lineage-specific genes (MLSGs). This may serve as an intelligent bioengineering prototype. The hypothesis is based on the fact that MLSGs regulate melanocyte differentiation through epigenetic reprogramming, which includes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), paired box 3 (PAX3), and Notch signaling. MITF directs the terminal differentiation of melanocytes, and PAX3 helps to establish the properties of the melanocyte stem cells. Notch signaling promotes adult stem cell proliferation and self-renewal. This process could be mimicked by Notch intracellular domain (NICD). MLSGs could also stimulate anti-apoptotic gene expression. Recent improvements in relevant biotechniques allow the transdermal delivery of MLSG proteins into the patient, where they enter cells through protein transduction. This process may promote melanocyte regeneration in situ with little impact on the hair follicular cycle or on carcinogenesis. This simple and efficient treatment may have significant impact on the treatment of vitiligo patients.",

Cell therapy is an attractive approach for treating muscle diseases, although this is hampered by the need to generate large numbers of functional muscle cells. Small molecules have become established as attractive tools for modulating cell behavior and, in this review, we discuss the recent, rapid research advances made in the development of small molecule methods to facilitate the production of functional cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. We also describe how new developments in small molecule strategies for muscle disease aim to induce repair and remodelling of the damaged tissues in situ. Recent progress has been made in developing small molecule cocktails that induce skeletal muscle regeneration, and these are discussed in a broader context, because a similar phenomenon occurs in the early stages of salamander appendage regeneration. Although formidable technical hurdles still remain, these new advances in small molecule-based methodologies should provide hope that cell therapies for patients suffering from muscle disease can be developed in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapy is a promising approach for repairing damaged heart. However, there are large rooms to be improved in therapeutic efficacy. We cultured a small quantity (5-10\u807dmg) of heart biopsy tissues from 16 patients who received heart transplantation. We produced primary and secondary cardiospheres (CSs) using repeated three-dimensional culture strategy and characterized the cells. Approximately 5000 secondary CSs were acquired after 45 days. Genetic analysis confirmed that the progenitor cells in the secondary CSs originated from the innate heart, but not from extra-cardiac organs. The expressions of Oct4 and Nanog were significantly induced in secondary CSs compared with adherent cells derived from primary CSs. Those expressions in secondary CSs were higher in a cytokine-deprived medium than in a cytokine-supplemented one, suggesting that formation of the three-dimensional structure was important to enhance stemness whereas supplementation with various cytokines was not essential. Signal blocking experiments showed that the ERK and VEGF pathways are indispensable for sphere formation. To optimize cell processing, we compared four different methods of generating spheres. Method based on the hanging-drop or AggreWell\u9229?was superior to that based on the poly-d-lysine-coated dish or Petri dish with respect to homogeneity of the product, cellular potency and overall simplicity of the process. When transplanted into the ischemic myocardium of immunocompromised mice, human secondary CSs differentiated into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that generation of secondary CSs from a small quantity of adult human cardiac tissue is a feasible and effective cell processing strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cell therapy.",

        "abstract": "Adoptive cell therapy has shown impressive efficacy to combat cancer in early phase clinical trials, in particular when T cells engineered to specifically target tumor cells were applied. The patient's T cells are genetically equipped with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which allows them to be redirected in a predefined manner towards virtually any target; by using an antibody-derived domain for binding, CAR T cells can be redirected in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) dependent and independent fashion. The CAR also provides the stimuli required to induce and maintain T cell activation. Recent clinical data sustain the notion that strong costimulation in conjunction with the primary activation signal is crucial for lasting therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells. However, costimulation is a double-edged sword and the impact of the individual costimuli to optimize T cell activation is still under debate; some general rules are emerging. The review summarizes how costimulation modulates, improves and prolongs the redirected anti-tumor T cell response and how the same costimulatory signals may contribute to unintended side effects including \"cytokine storm\" and T cell repression. Upcoming strategies to break the activation/repression circle by using CAR's with modified costimulatory signals are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Both enzymatic dissociation of cells prior to needle-based injections and poor vascularization of myocardial infarct areas are two important contributors to cell death and impede the efficacy of cardiac cell therapy. Because these limitations could be overcome by scaffolds ensuring cell cohesiveness and codelivery of angiogenic cells, we used a chronic rat model of myocardial infarction to assess the long-term (6 months) effects of the epicardial delivery of a composite collagen-based patch harboring both cardiomyogenesis-targeted human embryonic SSEA-1(+) (stem cell-derived stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 positive) cardiovascular progenitors and autologous (rat) adipose tissue-derived angiogenesis-targeted stromal cells (n = 27). Cell-free patches served as controls (n = 28). Serial follow-up echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) showed that the composite patch group yielded a significantly better preservation of left ventricular function that was sustained over time as compared with controls, and this pattern persisted when the assessment was restricted to the subgroup of rats with initial LVEFs below 50%. The composite patch group was also associated with significantly less fibrosis and more vessels in the infarct area. However, although human progenitors expressing cardiac markers were present in the patches before implantation, none of them could be subsequently identified in the grafted tissue. These data confirm the efficacy of epicardial scaffolds as cell carriers for ensuring long-term functional benefits and suggest that these effects are likely related to paracrine effects and call for optimizing cross-talks between codelivered cell populations to achieve the ultimate goal of myocardial regeneration.",

Four patients with stroke (three with ischemic and one with hemorrhagic stroke) in the middle cerebral artery territory were recruited in this study. One single dose of 2 \u8133 10(7) UCMSCs was infused within 20 min via catheterization in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. The safety and efficacy of this approach were assessed during the in-hospital and 6-month follow-up evaluation. The cell delivery was successfully performed in all of the patients, and no major accidents (stroke or death) were observed. Moreover, no fever or rash was reported. After cellular therapy, two of the three ischemic stroke patients demonstrated improved muscle strength. The improvement of the modified Rankin scale was observed in two patients, both of whom suffered from ischemic stroke at 90 and 180 days after the stem cell therapy. The hemorrhagic stroke patient failed to demonstrate improved muscle strength and did not amend his daily activities. Intra-artery delivery of UCMSCs via catheterization was a feasible and safe approach and may improve the neurological function of ischemic stroke patients with the middle cerebral artery territory infarcts.",

Adenovirally-delivered mouse Pdx1 (Ad-Pdx1) induced human Pdx1 expression in hAFSCs and enhanced the coordinated expression of downstream \u5c3e-cell markers. When Ad-Pdx1-transduced hAFSCs were sequentially treated with activin A, bFGF and nicotinamide and the culture plate surface coated with poly-l-ornithine, the expression of islet-associated human mRNAs for Pdx1, Pax6, Ngn3 and insulin was increased. C-peptide ELISA confirmed that Ad-Pdx1-transduced hAFSCs processed and secreted insulin in a manner consistent with that pathway in pancreatic \u5c3e-cells. To sustain the \u5c3e-cell-like phenotype and investigate the effect of three-dimensional (3D) conformation on the differentiation of hAFSCs, Pdx1-transduced cells were encapsulated in alginate and cultured long-term under serum-free conditions. Over 2\u9225\u5882eeks, partially differentiated hAFSC clusters increased in size and increased insulin secretion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ectopic Pdx1 expression initiates pancreatic differentiation in hAFSCs and that a \u5c3e-cell-like phenotype can be augmented by culture conditions that mimic the stromal components and 3D geometry associated with pancreatic islets.",

        "title": "Evolution of cellular immunotherapy: from allogeneic transplant to dendritic cell vaccination as treatment for multiple myeloma.",
        "abstract": "The promise of cellular therapy as treatment for multiple myeloma is highlighted by the observation that allogeneic transplantation results in durable remissions in a subset of patients. The potency of the graft-versus-myeloma effect is supported by the decreased risk of relapse seen in patients with graft-versus-host disease and disease response following donor lymphocyte infusions. However, the lack of specificity of the alloreactive lymphocytes limits their therapeutic efficacy and results in significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. A major area of investigation is the development of cancer vaccines to generate myeloma-specific immunity that selectively targets malignant cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Critical elements required to develop an effective vaccine strategy involve the identification of myeloma-associated antigens, enhancement of antigen presentation, and reversing the immunosuppressive milieu induced by the disease. Dendritic cells are potent APCs that represent an ideal platform for vaccination. Strategies for vaccine design include the loading of individual antigens as well as the use of whole tumor cells as a source of myeloma antigens. Vaccination has been examined in the postautologous transplant setting in which disease cytoreduction and depletion of Tregs is associated with enhanced vaccine response. Recent efforts have also included exploration of immune modulatory agents that target inhibitory pathways to enhance vaccine response and create a more durable antitumor immunity.",

        "abstract": "The replacement of functional pancreatic \u5c3e-cells is seen as an attractive potential therapy for diabetes, because diabetes results from an inadequate \u5c3e-cell mass. Inducing replication of the remaining \u5c3e-cells and new islet formation from progenitors within the pancreas (neogenesis) are the most direct ways to increase the \u5c3e-cell mass. Stimulation of both replication and neogenesis have been reported in rodents, but their clinical significance must still be shown. Because human islet transplantation is limited by the scarcity of donors and graft failure within a few years, efforts have recently concentrated on the use of stem cells to replace the deficient \u5c3e-cells. Currently, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells achieve high levels of \u5c3e-cell differentiation, but their clinical use is still hampered by ethical issues and/or the risk of developing tumors after transplantation. Pancreatic epithelial cells (duct, acinar, or \u4f2a-cells) represent an appealing alternative to stem cells because they demonstrate \u5c3e-cell differentiation capacities. Yet translation of such capacity to human cells after significant in vitro expansion has yet to be achieved. Besides providing new \u5c3e-cells, cell therapy also has to address the question on how to protect the transplanted cells from destruction by the immune system via either allo- or autoimmunity. Encouraging developments have been made in encapsulation and immunomodulation techniques, but many challenges still remain. Herein, we discuss recent advances in the search for \u5c3e-cell replacement therapies, current strategies for circumventing the immune system, and mandatory steps for new techniques to be translated from bench to clinics.",

Here, we developed a serum-free quality and quantity control culture system for colony-forming EPCs to enhance their regenerative potential. A culture with serum-free medium containing stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6, and Flt-3 ligand was determined as optimal quality and quantity culture (QQc) in terms of the most vasculogenic colony-forming EPC expansion, evaluated by the newly established EPC colony formation assay. The QQc of umbilical cord blood-CD133(+) cells for 7 days produced a 52.9-fold increase in total cell number and 3.28-fold frequency in definitive EPC colony development, resulting in a 203.9-fold increase in estimated total definitive EPC colony number in vitro. Pre- or post-QQc cells were intramyocardially transplanted into nude rats with myocardial infarction (MI). Echocardiographic and micromanometer-tipped conductance catheter examinations 28 days post-MI revealed significant preservation of left ventricular (LV) function in rats receiving pre- or post-QQc cells compared with those receiving phosphate-buffered saline. Assessments of global LV contractility indicated a dose-dependent effect of pre- or post-QQc cells and the superior potency of post-QQc cells over pre-QQc cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed more abundant formation of both human and rat endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes in the infarcted myocardium following transplantation of post-QQc cells compared with pre-QQc cells. Our optimal serum-free quality and quantity culture may enhance the therapeutic potential of EPCs in both quantitative and qualitative aspects for cardiovascular regeneration.",

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), commonly referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has been studied in several immune-associated diseases in human and animal by modulating the inflammatory response. Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATSCs), which can be obtained more easily, compared with BMSCs, has emerged as an attractive alternative MSCs source for cell therapy. We investigated the therapeutic effects of human ATSCs (hATSCs) in endotoxemic rat model and their capacity to modulate the inflammatory response. Endotoxemia was induced with Lipopolysaccaride intravenously injection (LPS, 10mg/kg). Animals were divided into the following three groups: (1) saline + saline (n=5), (2) LPS + saline (n=5) and (3) LPS + hATSCs (2x10(6)) (n=5). The administration of LPS caused a consistent systemic inflammatory responses, increased concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that have an important role in sepsis. Treatment of endotoxemia with hATSCs decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines both in serum and in the lung, reduced inflammatory changes in the lung, prevented apoptosis in the kidney and improved multi-organ injury. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that hATSCs regulate the immue/inflammatory responses and improve multi-organ injury and they could be attractive candidates for cell therapy to treat endotoxemia.",

This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic characterization of corneal stromal cells during culture expansion from the limbal region of the cornea. Isolated corneal keratocytes from limbal tissue of New Zealand White Strain rabbits' corneas (n = 6) were culture expanded until three passages. Keratocytes morphology was examined daily with viability, growth rate, number of cell doubling and population doubling time were recorded at each passage. The expression of collagen type 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), lumican and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u4f2a-SMA) were detected by RT-PCR. Immunocytochemistry was also used to detect ALDH, \u4f2a-SMA, collagen type I and Cytokeratin-3 (CK3). Growth kinetic study revealed that the growth rate was low at the initial passage but increase to about two folds with concomitant reduction in population doubling time in later passages. Freshly isolated and cultured keratocytes expressed collagen type 1, ALDH and lumican but \u4f2a-SMA expression was absent. However, \u4f2a-SMA was expressed along with the other genes during culture expansion. Keratocytes at P1 expressed all the proteins except CK3. These results suggest that cultured keratocytes maintained most of the gene expression profile of native keratocytes while the emergence of \u4f2a-SMA in serial passages showed a mix population of various phenotypes. The phenotypic characterization of monolayer keratocytes provides useful information before reconstruction of bioengineered tissue or in vitro pharmaceutical applications.",

When considering the impact of liver transplantation for metabolic disease two independent factors need to be considered; whether or not the defect causes liver disease and whether or not it is confined to the liver. When considering transplantation many factors need to be considered including the local success of transplantation, the impact of the metabolic disease on the patient and family and the potential for future therapeutic developments. Where transplantation is undertaken for a liver based defect there is a lifelong complete correction of the defect. Where there is a residual extrahepatic defect this will have an impact on the outcome of liver transplantation and the severity of this defect must be considered as part of the transplant assessment process. Access to a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in metabolic disease, liver disease and other relevant organ based specialists is crucial. Most children will receive transplantation from cadaveric donor but living related transplantation from a heterozygote parent is usually safe and effective. Auxiliary liver transplantation has a small but useful role where partial correction of the defect is helpful and there is a future prospect of gene therapy. The first-generation of hepatocyte transplants have shown proof of principle but to date have had a rather modest and temporary metabolic effect. Stem cells may have the potential to produce a more sustained and significant metabolic correction, but must be shown to be effective in controlled trials.",

        "abstract": "Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a clinically heterogeneous heritable skin fragility disorder characterized by mechanically induced mucocutaneous blistering. On the molecular level DEB is caused by mutations leading to deficiency in collagen VII (CVII), a large extracellular protein building anchoring fibrils that attach the epidermis to the dermis. Severely affected patients suffer from wounds, which heal with excessive scarring causing mutilating deformities of hands and feet. The patients are also predisposed to development of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas at sites of chronic wounds. Currently no available therapies exist for this extremely disabling and stigmatizing disorder. We are developing and evaluating cell- and protein-based therapies for the management of DEB. Dermal fibroblasts are easy to propagate in vitro, they produce CVII, and they have immunomodulating capacities, which makes it possible to use allogeneic fibroblasts for therapy without risking major adverse effects from the host's immune system. Hence, fibroblasts, and fibroblast-like cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells, are prime candidates for cell-based DEB therapies. An alternative for management of disorders caused by defects in proteins with relatively low turnover rate is to introduce the protein de novo to the tissue by direct application of the protein. CVII is long-lived and expressed in moderate amounts in the skin; this makes injection of collagen VII protein a realistic approach for the treatment of DEB. Here we present methods and protocols that we are using for fibroblast- and recombinant CVII-based therapies of DEB in our model of this disease, the CVII hypomorphic mouse. These protocols are directed towards management of DEB but they can be easily adapted for the treatment of other skin fragility disorders.",

The application of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as therapy gene allows noninvasive imaging of functional transgene expression by (123)I-scintigraphy or PET-imaging, as well as therapeutic application of (131)I or (188)Re. Based on the critical role of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted)/CCL5 secreted by MSCs in the course of tumor stroma recruitment, use of the RANTES/CCL5 promoter should allow tumor stroma-targeted expression of NIS after MSC-mediated delivery. Using a human hepatocellular cancer (HCC) xenograft mouse model (Huh7), we investigated distribution and tumor recruitment of RANTES-NIS-engineered MSCs after systemic injection by gamma camera imaging. (123)I-scintigraphy revealed active MSC recruitment and CCL5 promoter activation in the tumor stroma of Huh7 xenografts (6.5% ID/g (123)I, biological half-life: 3.7\u9225\u5870r, tumor-absorbed dose: 44.3\u9225\u5875Gy/MBq). In comparison, 7% ID/g (188)Re was accumulated in tumors with a biological half-life of 4.1\u9225\u5870r (tumor-absorbed dose: 128.7\u9225\u5875Gy/MBq). Administration of a therapeutic dose of (131)I or (188)Re (55.5\u9225\u584eBq) in RANTES-NIS-MSC-treated mice resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth and improved survival without significant differences between (131)I and (188)Re. These data demonstrate successful stromal targeting of NIS in HCC tumors by selective recruitment of NIS-expressing MSCs and by use of the RANTES/CCL5 promoter. The resulting tumor-selective radionuclide accumulation was high enough for a therapeutic effect of (131)I and (188)Re opening the exciting prospect of NIS-mediated radionuclide therapy of metastatic cancer using genetically engineered MSCs as gene delivery vehicles.",

Cultured limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) is frequently performed for corneal surface reconstruction with variable clinical success. This work summarizes recent developments and trends that have the potential to increase safety and efficacy of CLET in the future. Apart from gradual transition to xenobiotic-free culture systems, novel biofunctional scaffolds presenting components of stem cell microenvironments aim at promoting long-term maintenance of stem cells in vitro and after transplantation. Hair follicles and other tissues may serve as autologous sources of adult stem cells in bilateral ocular surface disease. However, despite all progress made in the fields of tissue engineering and cell therapy, it is unlikely that CLET will yield fully satisfactory clinical results until the factors that govern limbal stem cell maintenance and differentiation are identified.",

        "abstract": "The liver is affected by many types of diseases, including metabolic disorders and acute liver failure. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is currently the only effective treatment for life-threatening liver diseases but transplantation of allogeneic hepatocytes has now become an alternative as it is less invasive than OLT and can be performed repeatedly. However, this approach is hampered by the shortage of organ donors, and the problems related to the isolation of high quality adult hepatocytes, their cryopreservation and their absence of proliferation in culture. Liver is also a key organ to assess the pharmacokinetics and toxicology of xenobiotics and for drug discovery, but appropriate cell culture systems are lacking. All these problems have highlighted the need to explore other sources of cells such as stem cells that could be isolated, expanded to yield sufficiently large populations and then induced to differentiate into functional hepatocytes. The presence of a niche of \"facultative\" progenitor and stem cells in the normal liver has recently been confirmed but they display no telomerase activity. The recent discovery that human induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from somatic cells has renewed hopes for regenerative medicine and in vitro disease modelling, as these cells are easily accessible. We review here the present progresses, limits and challenges for the generation of functional hepatocytes from human pluripotent stem cells in view of their potential use in regenerative medicine and drug discovery.",

Quantitative evaluation of the characteristic mutation rate of a given stem cell line could be an important criterion in making the decision to use the line in medical practice. Such an evaluation could provide a new quality standard for newly derived human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines prior to depositing them in stem cell banks. Here, we substantiate this view with simple calculations showing the effect of the mutation rate on changes in the cell population composition due to amplification. Selection of SCs with low mutation rate could reduce the risk of negative side effects during treatment.",

DMOADs can slow the progression of joint damage. Cell-based therapies have evolved to do the same, through selection of the most potent cell types (and combinations thereof), as well as identification of permissive boundary conditions for indications. Joint distraction techniques, meanwhile, have now demonstrated the capacity to stimulate actual intrinsic tissue repair. Although this progress is promising, true biological joint reconstruction remains distant on the developmental pathway of 'regenerative medicine'. Prolonged functional repair--that is, cure of diseases such as OA--remains an unmet medical need and scientific challenge, for which comparative and constructive interaction between these physical, chemical and cellular approaches will be required. Careful selections of patients and combinations of approaches will need to be made and tested to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness. Only with such rational and integrated assessment of outcomes will the promising results of these approaches be consolidated in clinical practice.",

Hydrogels have taken prominence as a tissue engineered strategy to restore normal vocal structure and function as cellularity is low. The frequent vibrational and shear forces applied to, and present in this connective tissue make mechanical properties of such hydrogels a priority in this active area of research. Hyaluronic acid has been chemically modified in a variety of ways to address cell function while maintaining desirable tissue mechanical properties. These various modifications have had mixed results when injected in vivo typically resulting in better biomechanical function but not necessarily with a concomitant decrease in tissue fibrosis. Recent work has focused on seeding mesenchymal progenitor cells within 3D architecture of crosslinked hydrogels. The data from these studies demonstrate that this approach has a positive effect on cells in both early and late wound healing, but little work has been done regarding the biomechanical effects of these treatments. This paper provides an overview of the various hyaluronic acid derivatives, their crosslinking agents, and their effect when implanted into the vocal folds of various animal models.",

        "abstract": "Human embryo stem cells or adult tissues are excellent models for discovery and characterization of differentiation processes. The aims of regenerative medicine are to define the molecular and physiological mechanisms that govern stem cells and differentiation. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells that are able to differentiate into a variety of cell types under controlled conditions both in vivo and in vitro, and they have the remarkable ability of self-renewal. hMSCs derived from amniotic fluid and characterized by the expression of Oct-4 and Nanog, typical markers of pluripotent cells, represent an excellent model for studies on stemness. Unfortunately, the limited amount of cells available from each donation and, above all, the limited number of replications do not allow for detailed studies. Here, we report on the immortalization and characterization of novel mesenchymal progenitor (MePR) cell lines from amniotic fluid-derived hMSCs, whose biological properties are similar to primary amniocytes. Our data indicate that MePR cells display the multipotency potential and differentiation rates of hMSCs, thus representing a useful model to study both mechanisms of differentiation and pharmacological approaches to induce selective differentiation. In particular, MePR-2B cells, which carry a bona fide normal karyotype, might be used in basic stem cell research, leading to the development of new approaches for stem cell therapy and tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Two types of alternatively activated macrophages, M(2a) induced by IL-4/IL-13 and M(2c) by IL-10/TGF-\u5c3e, exhibit anti-inflammatory functions in vitro and protect against renal injury in vivo. Since their relative therapeutic efficacy is unclear, we compared the effects of these two macrophage subsets in murine adriamycin nephrosis. Both subsets significantly reduced renal inflammation and renal injury; however, M(2c) macrophages more effectively reduced glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial expansion, and proteinuria than M(2a) macrophages. The M(2c) macrophages were also more effective than M(2a) in reduction of macrophage and CD4(+) T-cell infiltration in kidney. Moreover, nephrotic mice treated with M(2c) had a greater reduction in renal fibrosis than those treated with M(2a). M(2c) but not M(2a) macrophages induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) from CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells in vitro, and increased Treg numbers in local draining lymph nodes of nephrotic mice. To determine whether the greater protection with M(2c) was due to their capability to induce Tregs, the Tregs were depleted by PC61 antibody in nephrotic mice treated with M(2a) or M(2c). Treg depletion diminished the superior effects of M(2c) compared to M(2a) in protection against renal injury, inflammatory infiltrates, and renal fibrosis. Thus, M(2c) are more potent than M(2a) macrophages in protecting against renal injury due to their ability to induce Tregs.",

        "abstract": "Despite continued progress in the development of novel antiretroviral therapies, it has become increasingly evident that drug-based treatments will not lead to a functional or sterilizing cure for HIV(+) patients. In 2009, an HIV(+) patient was effectively cured of HIV following allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a CCR5(-/-) donor. The utility of this approach, however, is severely limited because of the difficulty in finding matched donors. Hence, we studied the potential of HIV-resistant stem cells in the autologous setting in a nonhuman primate AIDS model and incorporated a fusion inhibitor (mC46) as the means for developing infection-resistant cells. Pigtail macaques underwent identical transplants and Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) challenge procedures with the only variation between control and mC46 macaques being the inclusion of a fusion-inhibitor expression cassette. Following SHIV challenge, mC46 macaques, but not control macaques, showed a positive selection of gene-modified CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes, accounting for >90% of the total CD4(+) T-cell population. mC46 macaques also maintained high frequencies of SHIV-specific, gene-modified CD4(+) T cells, an increase in nonmodified CD4(+) T cells, enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte function, and antibody responses. These data suggest that HSC protection may be a potential alternative to conventional antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV/AIDS.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapy in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) is effective after intrastriatal grafting of dopamine (DA) neurons, whereas intranigral transplantation of dopaminergic cells does not cause consistent behavioral recovery. One strategy to promote axonal growth of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (SN) to the striatum is degradation of inhibitory components such as chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPG). An alternative is the guidance of DA axons by chemotropic agents. Semaphorins 3A and 3C enhance axonal growth of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in vitro, while Semaphorin 3C also attracts them. We asked whether intranigral transplantation of DA neurons, combined with either degradation of CSPG or with grafts of Semaphorin 3-expressing cells, towards the striatum, is effective in establishing a new nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in rats with unilateral depletion of DA neurons. We found depolarization-induced DA release in dorsal striatum, DA axonal projections from SN to striatum, and concomitant behavioral improvement in Semaphorin 3-treated animals. These effects were absent in animals that received intranigral transplants combined with Chondroitinase ABC treatment, although partial degradation of CSPG was observed. These results are evidence that Semaphorin 3-directed long-distance axonal growth of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in behavioral improvement, is possible in adult diseased brains.",

The principal reasons for the poor outcomes of GBM are the high rates of recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the role of tailored cellular therapy for GBM with a poor prognosis and compare the activity of dendritic cells (DCs) that have encountered GBM cells. Detecting the correlations between methylation and expression of MGMT and PTEN genes and GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers after co-cultures with a mononuclear cell cocktail are also aims for this study. Allogenic umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived DCs were labeled with the CD11a and CD123 for immature DCs, and CD80 and CD11c for mature DCs. CD34, CD45, and CD56 cells were isolated from allogenic UCB for using in DCs maturation. GBM CSCs were detected with CD133/1 and CD111 antibodies after co-culture studies. DC activation was carried out via GBM cells including CD133 and CD111 cells and a mononuclear cells cocktail including CD34, CD45, and CD56 natural killer cells. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression and promoter methylation status of PTEN and MGMT genes. The expression of CSCs markers was found in all GBM cases, and a statistically significant correlation was found among them after co-culture studies. The most pronounced affinity of DCs to GBM cells was observed at dilutions between 1/4 and 1/256 in co-cultures. There was a statistically significant correlation between cellularity and granularity ratios for CD123 and CD11c. PTEN and MGMT gene expression and methylation values were evaluated with respect to CSCs expression and no statistical significance was found. Activation of DCs might associate with CSCs and the mononuclear cells cocktail including CD34, CD45, and CD56 cells which were obtained from allogenic UCB.",

Using India as a model system and obtaining input from regulators, clinicians, academics, and industry representatives across the stem cell field in India, we reviewed the role of key agencies and processes involved in this field. We have identified areas that need attention and here provide solutions from other established and functioning models in the world to streamline and unify the regulatory and ethics approval processes for cell-based therapies. We also make recommendations to check the growth and functioning of clinics offering unproven treatments. Addressing these issues will remove considerable hurdles to both local and international investigators, accelerate the pace of research and development, and create a quality environment for reliable products to emerge. By doing so, these countries would have taken one important step to move to the forefront of stem cell-based therapeutics.",

Strategies to improve outcome and prevent relapse are therefore required. Immunotherapy with antigen-specific T cells can have antileukemic activity without the toxicities seen with intensive chemotherapy, and therefore represents an attractive strategy to improve the outcome of high-risk patients with ALL. We explored the feasibility of generating tumor antigen-specific T cells ex vivo from the peripheral blood of 50 patients with ALL [26 National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk and 24 standard-risk] receiving maintenance therapy.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a global epidemic in developed countries. Cumulative evidence suggests that myocyte formation is preserved during postnatal life, in adulthood or senescence, suggesting the existence of a growth reserve of the heart throughout lifespan. Several medical therapeutic approaches to CVD have considerably improved the clinical outcome for patients. Intense interest has been focused on regenerative medicine as an emerging strategy for CVD. Cellular therapeutic approaches have been proposed for enhancing survival and propagation of stem cells in myocardium, leading to cardiac cellular repair. Strong epidemiological and clinical data exists concerning the impact of regular physical exercise on cardiovascular health. Several mechanisms of acute and chronic exercise-induced cardiovascular adaptations to exercise have been presented, considering primary and secondary prevention of CVD. In this context, exercise-related improvements in the function and regeneration of the cardiovascular system may be associated with the exercise-induced activation, mobilization, differentiation, and homing of stem and progenitor cells. In this review several topics will be addressed concerning the relation between exercise, recruitment and biological activity of blood-circulating progenitor cells and resident cardiac stem cells. We hypothesize that exercise-induced stem cell activation may enhance overall heart function and improve the efficacy of cardiac cellular therapeutic protocols.",

        "abstract": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the mdx mouse model, the absence of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin causes defective anchoring of myofibres to the basal lamina. The resultant myofibre degeneration and necrosis lead to a progressive loss of muscle mass, increased fibrosis and ultimately fatal weakness. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN-2) is critically involved in several chronic fibro-degenerative diseases. In DMD, the role of CTGF might extend well beyond replacement fibrosis secondary to loss of muscle fibres, since its overexpression in skeletal muscle could by itself induce a dystrophic phenotype. Using two independent approaches, we here show that mdx mice with reduced CTGF availability do indeed have less severe muscular dystrophy. Mdx mice with hemizygous CTGF deletion (mdx-Ctgf+/-), and mdx mice treated with a neutralizing anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody (FG-3019), performed better in an exercise endurance test, had better muscle strength in isolated muscles and reduced skeletal muscle impairment, apoptotic damage and fibrosis. Transforming growth factor type-\u5c3e (TGF-\u5c3e), pERK1/2 and p38 signalling remained unaffected during CTGF suppression. Moreover, both mdx-Ctgf+/- and FG-3019 treated mdx mice had improved grafting upon intramuscular injection of dystrophin-positive satellite cells. These findings reveal the potential of targeting CTGF to reduce disease progression and to improve cell therapy in DMD.",

        "abstract": "This review summarizes recent efforts to create vascularized bone tissue in vitro and in vivo through the use of cell-based therapy approaches. The treatment of large and recalcitrant bone wounds is a serious clinical problem, and in the United States approximately 10% of all fractures are complicated by delayed union or non-union. Treatment approaches with the use of growth factor and gene delivery have shown some promise, but results are variable and clinical complications have arisen. Cell-based therapies offer the potential to recapitulate key components of the bone-healing cascade, which involves concomitant regeneration of vasculature and new bone tissue. For this reason, osteogenic and vasculogenic cell types have been combined in co-cultures to capitalize on the function of each cell type and to promote heterotypic interactions. Experiments in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems have provided insight into the mechanisms by which osteogenic and vasculogenic cells interact to form vascularized bone, and these approaches have been translated to ectopic and orthotopic models in small-animal studies. The knowledge generated by these studies will inform and facilitate the next\u807dgeneration of pre-clinical studies, which are needed to move cell-based orthopaedic repair strategies into the clinic. The\u807dscience and application of cytotherapy for repair of large and ischemic bone defects is developing rapidly and promises to provide new treatment methods for these challenging clinical problems.",

Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, a subset of T lymphocytes, have the capacity to eliminate cancer cells. This study was to evaluate the correlation between the frequency of DC/CIK immunotherapies following regular chemotherapy, the time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) of advanced non-small lung cancer patients. Sixty patients with IIIB-IV non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) were enrolled from August 2007 to December 2009 and were randomized into two groups. All 60 patients received four courses of navelbine-platinum (NP) chemotherapy. In one group, 30 patients were treated with adoptive autologous DC/CIK cell transfusion twice every 30 days. In the other group, the patients received immunotherapies more than twice every 30 days. The adverse effects, TTP, and OS were evaluated between the two groups. Median survival time of all 60 patients was 13.80 months. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 60.0, 21.7, and 15.0 %, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates of patients receiving more than two immunotherapies were 63.3, 30.0, and 23.3 %, and the rates of those receiving two immunotherapies were 56.7, 13.3, and 6.7 %, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.037). Compared with patients in the fewer immunotherapies group, TTP in the group receiving more immunotherapies significantly prolonged, with the median improving from 6.2 months (95 % CI, 5.35-9.24) to 7.3 months (95 % CI, 5.45-6.95; P = 0.034). The adverse effects of chemoimmunotherapy were tolerable. Advanced NSCLC patients can benefit from the combination of DC/CIK immunotherapies following conventional chemotherapy. More than two immunotherapies improved TTP and OS of those patients in this study.",

There is presently no cure for OI. We previously showed that human first trimester fetal blood mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplanted into a murine OI model (oim mice) improved the phenotype. However, the clinical use of fetal MSC is constrained by their limited number and low availability. In contrast, human fetal early chorionic stem cells (e-CSC) can be used without ethical restrictions and isolated in high numbers from the placenta during ongoing pregnancy. Here, we show that intraperitoneal injection of e-CSC in oim neonates reduced fractures, increased bone ductility and bone volume (BV), increased the numbers of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and upregulated endogenous genes involved in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Exogenous cells preferentially homed to long bone epiphyses, expressed osteoblast genes, and produced collagen COL1A2. Together, our data suggest that exogenous cells decrease bone brittleness and BV by directly differentiating to osteoblasts and indirectly stimulating host chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In conclusion, the placenta is a practical source of stem cells for the treatment of OI.",

We evaluated the treatment of excisional and diabetic wounds using a stem cell isolated from the human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (hWJSC) that shares unique properties with embryonic and adult mesenchymal stem cells. hWJSCs are non-controversial, available in abundance, hypo-immunogenic, non-tumorigenic, differentiate into keratinocytes, and secrete important molecules for tissue repair. When human skin fibroblasts (CCD) in conventional scratch-wound assays were exposed to hWJSC-conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM) the fibroblasts at the wound edges migrated and completely covered the spaces by day 2 compared to controls. The number of invaded cells, cell viability, total collagen, elastin, and fibronectin levels were significantly greater in the hWJSC-CM treatment arm compared to controls (P\u9225?\u9225?.05). When a single application of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled hWJSCs (GFP-hWJSCs) or hWJSC-CM was administered to full-thickness murine excisional and diabetic wounds, healing rates were significantly greater compared to controls (P\u9225?\u9225?.05). Wound biopsies collected at various time points showed the presence of green GFP-labeled hWJSCs, positive human keratinocyte markers (cytokeratin, involucrin, filaggrin) and expression of ICAM-1, TIMP-1, and VEGF-A. On histology, the GFP-hWJSCs and hWJSC-CM treated wounds showed reepithelialization, increased vascularity and cellular density and increased sebaceous gland and hair follicle numbers compared to controls. hWJSCs showed increased expression of several miRNAs associated with wound healing compared to CCDs. Our studies demonstrated that hWJSCs enhance healing of excisional and diabetic wounds via differentiation into keratinocytes and release of important molecules.",

This work prepared three-dimensional aggregates of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cord-blood mesenchymal stem cells (cbMSCs) with different levels of internal hypoxia by a methylcellulose hydrogel system. We found that few apoptosis occurred in these cell aggregates, despite developing a hypoxic microenvironment in their inner cores. Via effectively switching on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u4f2a-dependent angiogenic mechanisms, culturing the internally hypoxic HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates on Matrigel resulted in formation of extensive and persistent tubular networks and significant upregulation of pro-angiogenic genes. As the level of internal hypoxia created in cell aggregates increased, the robustness of the tubular structures developed on Matrigel increased, and expression levels of the pro-angiogenic genes also elevated. Transplantation of hypoxic HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates into a mouse model of an ischemic limb significantly promoted formation of functional vessels, improved regional blood perfusion, and attenuated muscle atrophy and bone losses, thereby rescuing tissue degeneration. Notably, their therapeutic efficacy was clearly dependent upon the level of internal hypoxia established in cell aggregates. These analytical results demonstrate that by establishing a hypoxic environment in HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates, their potential for therapeutic neovascularization can be markedly enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can regenerate tissues by direct differentiation or indirectly by stimulating angiogenesis, limiting inflammation, and recruiting tissue-specific progenitor cells. MSCs emerge and multiply in long-term cultures of total cells from the bone marrow or multiple other organs. Such a derivation in vitro is simple and convenient, hence popular, but has long precluded understanding of the native identity, tissue distribution, frequency, and natural role of MSCs, which have been defined and validated exclusively in terms of surface marker expression and developmental potential in culture into bone, cartilage, and fat. Such simple, widely accepted criteria uniformly typify MSCs, even though some differences in potential exist, depending on tissue sources. Combined immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and cell culture have allowed tracking the artifactual cultured mesenchymal stem/stromal cells back to perivascular anatomical regions. Presently, both pericytes enveloping microvessels and adventitial cells surrounding larger arteries and veins have been described as possible MSC forerunners. While such a vascular association would explain why MSCs have been isolated from virtually all tissues tested, the origin of the MSCs grown from umbilical cord blood remains unknown. In fact, most aspects of the biology of perivascular MSCs are still obscure, from the emergence of these cells in the embryo to the molecular control of their activity in adult tissues. Such dark areas have not compromised intents to use these cells in clinical settings though, in which purified perivascular cells already exhibit decisive advantages over conventional MSCs, including purity, thorough characterization and, principally, total independence from in vitro culture. A growing body of experimental data is currently paving the way to the medical usage of autologous sorted perivascular cells for indications in which MSCs have been previously contemplated or actually used, such as bone regeneration and cardiovascular tissue repair.",

These cells have two important properties, which are the self-renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate into any cell type of the human body. So, the discovery of hiPSCs opens new opportunities in biomedical sciences, since these cells may be useful for understanding the mechanisms of diseases in the production of new diseases models, in drug development/drug toxicity tests, gene therapies, and cell replacement therapies. However, the hiPSCs technology has limitations including the potential for the development of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities leading to tumorigenicity. Nowadays, basic research in the hiPSCs field has made progress in the application of new strategies with the aim to enable an efficient production of high-quality of hiPSCs for safety and efficacy, necessary to the future application for clinical practice. In this review, we show the recent advances in hiPSCs' basic research and some potential clinical applications focusing on cancer.

To date, there are no reports of stem cell sources with all of these characteristics, despite claims otherwise. Here we report the results of preclinical studies with appropriate animals models of metabolic liver disease and acute liver failure, and their correction by the transplantation of human amnion epithelial stem cells.

However, there is still argumentative for the safety and efficacy of MSCs in the AMI setting. We thus performed a randomized pilot study to investigate the safety and efficacy of MSCs in patients with AMI. Eighty patients with AMI after successful reperfusion therapy were randomly assigned and received an intracoronary administration of autologous BM-derived MSCs into the infarct related artery at 1 month. During follow-up period, 58 patients completed the trial. The primary endpoint was changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at 6 month. We also evaluated treatment-related adverse events. The absolute improvement in the LVEF by SPECT at 6 month was greater in the BM-derived MSCs group than in the control group (5.9% \u5364 8.5% vs 1.6% \u5364 7.0%; P=0.037). There was no treatment-related toxicity during intracoronary administration of MSCs. No significant adverse cardiovascular events occurred during follow-up. In conclusion, the intracoronary infusion of human BM-derived MSCs at 1 month is tolerable and safe with modest improvement in LVEF at 6-month follow-up by SPECT.

Existing medical and interventional therapies can only reduce the loss of cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction but are unable to replenish the permanent loss of cardiomyocytes after the insult, which contributes to progressive pathological left ventricular remodeling and progressive heart failure. As a result, cell-based therapies using multipotent (adult) stem cells and pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells) have been explored as potential therapeutic approaches to restore cardiac function in heart failure. Nevertheless, the optimal cell type with the best therapeutic efficacy and safety for heart regeneration is still unknown.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of transplanting bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) to treat children with complete interruption of spinal cord (SC) continuity. The present study was conducted from 2005 to 2011. The inclusion criteria were a magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed complete interruption of SC continuity and no improvement in neurological status within 6 months after standard therapy. Bone marrow was isolated from the iliac ala and submitted to BMNC isolation. Subsequently, the cell suspension was administered into the SC cavity and intravenously. In total, 18 of 19 intraspinal and intravenous BMNC transplantation procedures performed caused no adverse events. One case was connected with transient bradycardia. The experimental therapy showed no late complications in the 1- to 6-year follow-up evaluation period. Neurological improvement was observed in two patients who received multiple implantations. One patient demonstrated improved superficial sensation from Th3 to Th12/L1 and a restored bladder-filling sensation. In the other case, superficial sensation was improved from C2 to C5, and the respiratory drive, the swallowing reflex, and tongue movements were restored. Spasticity and quality of life were improved in three of five patients. In addition, skin pressure ulcers healed and did not recur. Our preliminary results demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BMNC transplantation in children with complete SC injury. The results indicate that a certain degree of neurological and quality-of-life improvement can be attained by children with chronic complete SC injury who receive multiple BMNC implantations.",

        "abstract": "A 2-year-old boy with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was referred for recurrent sinopulmonary infections. He was diagnosed shortly after birth by a fluorescence in situ hybridization test that was performed due to interrupted aortic arch type B. He had no hypocalcemia, and his recovery from cardiac repair was uneventful. He had difficulty feeding and gained weight slowly, but, otherwise, there were no concerns during his first year of life. At 15 months of age, he began to develop significant otitis media and bronchitis. He was hospitalized once for pneumonia at 18 months of age and has never been off antibiotics for more than 1 week since then. He has not had any previous immunologic evaluation. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections in a child with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can have the same etiologies as in any other child. Atopy, anatomic issues, cystic fibrosis, and new environmental exposures could be considered in this setting. Early childhood can be problematic for patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome due to unfavorable drainage of the middle ear and sinuses. Atopy occurs at a higher frequency in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and these children also have a higher rate of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration than the general population. As would be appropriate for any child who presents with recurrent infections at 2 years of age, an immunologic evaluation should be performed. In this review, we will highlight recent findings and new data on the management of children and adults with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells recognize deranged cells that display stress receptors or loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. During development, NK cells become \"licensed\" only after they encounter cognate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, leading to the acquisition of effector function. NK cells can be exploited for cancer therapy in several ways. These include targeting with monoclonal antibodies alone or combined with ex vivo and in vivo NK cell activation to facilitate adoptive immunotherapy using donor-derived NK cell products to induce graft-vs-tumor effects. In the adoptive transfer setting, persistence and in vivo expansion requires lymphodepleting chemotherapy to prevent rejection and provide homeostatic cytokines (such as IL-15) that activate NK cells. IL-15 has the advantage of avoiding regulatory T-cell expansion. Clinical applications are currently being tested. To enhance in vivo expansion, IL-2 has been used at low doses. However, low dose administration also leads to the stimulation of regulatory T cells. Monoclonal antibodies and bispecific killer engagers (BiKEs) may enhance specificity by targeting CD16 on NK cells to tumor antigens. Inhibition of CD16 shedding may also promote enhanced cytotoxicity. Future strategies include exploiting favorable donor immunogenetics or ex vivo expansion of NK cells from blood, progenitors, or pluripotent cells. Comparative clinical trials are needed to test these approaches.",

        "abstract": "Cell transplantation/replacement therapy is attractive as a novel strategy for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. To realize this therapy, safer and more therapeutic effective cell resources are now required. Since induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can retain high replication competence and pluripotency when they differentiate into various kinds of cells, they are regarded as a promising cell source for cell transplantation therapy. However, high tumorigenesis of iPSCs has to be overcome for clinical applications. Recent progress includes the combination of novel transcriptional factors that can convert somatic cells to various kinds of mature neuronal cells and neural stem cells without requiring iPSC fate. Some evidence indicates that these directly induced neuronal cells have little tumorigenic potential. In this article, we discuss the advantage, issues, and possibility of clinical application of these cells for cell transplantation therapy.",

However, some of these have also been complicated by significant adverse reactions. As the field moves towards definitive late stage trials, with a growing interest from pharmaceutical companies, we realize that novel cell therapy strategies pose questions that are familiar to traditional drug development, along with new considerations due to the potential of T cells to persist long term and to expand after adoptive transfer. These questions address the safety of the product, the efficacy, the mode of action, and the anticipation of risks. From different perspectives, we intend to address exciting opportunities and safety concerns in current concepts of cellular immunotherapy.",

Age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa are two common retinal diseases resulting in photoreceptor loss and vision impairment or blindness. Presently, available treatments can only delay the progress of retinal degeneration, and there are no treatments that can restore permanent vision loss. Research is underway to develop methods of regenerating the impaired retina by delivering photoreceptor precursor cells and retinal pigment epithelium to the subretinal space. Challenges to cell transplantation include limited survival upon implantation and the formation of abnormal cell architectures in vivo. Retinal tissue engineering shows immense promise and potential in treatment of retinal degeneration by employing scaffold-based delivery systems of retinal progenitor cells to the subretinal space. Scaffold delivery strategy has been shown to enhance the cell survival and direct cell differentiation in a variety of retinal degenerative models. In this chapter, we summarize the research findings on different scaffold- or substrate-based transplantation techniques used to deliver retinal progenitor/photoreceptor precursors and retinal pigment epithelial cells to the subretinal space.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell therapy is a promising approach to regenerate healthy tissues starting from a limited amount of self-renewing cells. Immunological rejection of cell therapy products might represent a major limitation. In this study, we investigated the immunological functional profile of mesoangioblasts, vessel-associated myogenic stem cells, currently tested in a phase 1-2a trial, active in our Institute, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We report that in resting conditions, human mesoangioblasts are poorly immunogenic, inefficient in promoting the expansion of alloreactive T cells and intrinsically resistant to T-cell killing. However, upon exposure to interferon-\u7eac or differentiation into myotubes, mesoangioblasts acquire the ability to promote the expansion of alloreactive T cells and acquire sensitivity to T-cell killing. Resistance of mesoangioblasts to T-cell killing is largely due to the expression of the intracellular serine protease inhibitor-9 and represents a relevant mechanism of stem cell immune evasion.",

Over the last 3 years, the TERMIS-EU Industry Committee has worked with commercial bodies to deliver programs that encourage academics to liaise with industry in proactive collaborations. The TERMIS-EU 2013 Industry Symposium aimed to build on this commercial agenda by focusing on two topics: Operations Management (How to move a process into the good manufacturing practice [GMP] environment) and Clinical Translation (Moving a GMP process into robust trials). These topics were introduced by providing the synergistic business perspective of partnering between the multiple regenerative medicine stakeholders, throughout the life cycle of product development. Seven industry leaders were invited to share their experience, expertise, and strategies. Due to the complex nature of regenerative medicine products, partnering for their successful commercial development seems inevitable to overcome all obstacles by sharing experiences and expertise of all stakeholders. When ideally implemented, the \"innovation quotient\" of a virtual team resulting from the combination of internal and external project teams can be maximized through maximizing the three main dimensions: core competences, technology portfolio, and alliance management.",

        "abstract": "Metaplasia is the irreversible conversion of one differentiated cell or tissue type into another. Metaplasia usually occurs in tissues that undergo regeneration, and may, in a pathological context, predispose to an increased risk of disease. Studying the conditions leading to the development of metaplasia is therefore of significant clinical interest. In contrast, transdifferentiation (or cellular reprogramming) is a subset of metaplasia that describes the permanent conversion of one differentiated cell type into another, and generally occurs between cells that arise from neighbouring regions of the same germ layer. Transdifferentiation, although rare, has been shown to occur in Nature. New insights into the signalling pathways involved in normal tissue development may be obtained by investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms in metaplasia and transdifferentiation, and additional identification of key molecular regulators in transdifferentiation and metaplasia could provide new targets for therapeutic treatment of diseases such as cancer, as well as generating cells for transplantation into patients with degenerative disorders. In the present review, we focus on the transdifferentiation of pancreatic cells into hepatocyte-like cells, the development of Barrett's metaplasia in the oesophagus, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying both processes.",

The cell surface marker and the multiple differentiation ability of fresh isolated PLA and LAF cells and which from passaged 3-5 were examined in vitro. LAF cells were then incubated in adipogenic medium, stained with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI), mixed with fibrin glue then injected to nude mice; fibrin glue without cells was as a control. Three months later, the transplants were subjected to macroscopic observation and histological analysis. PLA and LAF cells were similar in growth kinetics, morphology, capacity for differentiation, and surface marker profiles. After plating, both PLA and LAF cells showed increased expression of CD29, CD44, CD133 and HLA DR and decreased expression of CD34. In vivo differentiation assay showed the mixture of LAF cells and fibrin glue formed adipose tissue which contained red fluorescent DiI-positive adipocytes. LAF cells can be harvested more easily than PLA cells. The in vivo adipogenic capacity suggested LAF cells would be useful and valuable for cell-based therapies and soft tissue reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "After an extensive myocardial infarction, restoration of heart function depends on the ability of the heart to promote regeneration and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. Preclinical research demonstrated that the transplantation of healthy stem cells restored heart function, but the stem cells obtained from older animals or patients were not as efficacious as those from younger individuals. In this paper, we review the successes and limitations discovered in preclinical studies and clinical trials examining cell therapy for damaged hearts. After the modest successes of the early clinical trials, research is now exploring the benefits of enhanced stem cell therapy. Cell based gene therapy markedly improves the angiogenesis achieved. Rejuvenating aged stems cells prior to transplantation restores the functional benefits attained. Transplanting healthy allogeneic stem cells from young donors into aged individuals can restore function if rejection can be prevented. Finally, modulating the cellular environment in aged individuals permits the full functional benefits of stem cell therapy to be realized. Significant challenges remain, but these approaches show promise that cell therapy may become routine therapy to improve functional recovery of older patients after an extensive myocardial infarction.",

These deleterious reactions involve the activation of the complement and coagulation cascades and platelet and leukocyte activation, ultimately resulting in clot formation and damage to the implanted cells. In this concept review, we discuss the basic mechanisms underlying the thrombininflammatory process, with special reference to the engagement of complement and emerging strategies for the therapeutic regulation of these reactions that include the use of selective systemic inhibitors and various procedures to coat the surfaces of the cells. The coating procedures may also be applied to other treatment modalities in which similar mechanisms are involved, including whole organ transplantation, treatment with biomaterials in contact with blood, and extracorporeal procedures.",

        "abstract": "The receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) accounts for many features of cancer progression, and is therefore considered a target for anti-tumoral therapy. Only full length uPAR mediates tumor progression. Matrix-metallo-proteinase-12 (MMP12)-dependent uPAR cleavage results into the loss of invasion properties and angiogenesis. MMP12 can be employed in the field of \"targeted therapies\" as a biological drug to be delivered directly in patient's tumor mass. Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are selectively recruited within the tumor and could be used as cellular vehicles for delivering anti-cancer molecules. The aim of our study is to inhibit cancer progression by engeneering ECFCs, a subset of EPC, with a lentivirus encoding the anti-tumor uPAR-degrading enzyme MMP12. Ex vivo manipulated ECFCs lost the capacity to perform capillary morphogenesis and acquired the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenetic activity. In vivo MMP12-engineered ECFCs cleaved uPAR within the tumor mass and strongly inhibited tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and development of lung metastasis. The possibility to exploit tumor homing and activity of autologous MMP12-engineered ECFCs represents a novel way to combat melanoma by a \"personalized therapy\", without rejection risk. The i.v. injection of radiolabelled MMP12-ECFCs can thus provide a new theranostic approach to control melanoma progression and metastasis.",

Because of their inherent chemoresistance, they exert potent bystander and antitumor effect. Here we show that the human adipose tissue-derived MSC expressing fusion yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD-MSC) in combination with 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) mediated a long-term tumor-free survival in the 83.3% of tumor-bearing animals. CD-MSC/5FC treatment induced cytotoxicity against model human melanoma cells EGFP-A375. Only 4% of the therapeutic CD-MSC cells eliminated >98.5% of the tumor cells in vitro. Long-term tumor-free survival was confirmed in 15 out of the 18 animals. However, repeatedly used CD-MSC/5FC therapeutic regimen generated more aggressive and metastatic variant of the melanoma cells EGFP-A375/Rel3. These cells derived from the refractory xenotransplants exhibited increased resistance to the CD-MSC/5FC treatment, altered cell adhesion, migration, tumorigenic and metastatic properties. However, long-term curative effect was achieved by the augmentation of the CD-MSC/5FC regimen along with the inhibition of c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor signaling axis in this aggressive melanoma derivative. In summary, the CD-MSC/5FC regimen can be regarded as a very effective antitumor approach to achieve long-term tumor-free survival as demonstrated on a mouse model of aggressive human melanoma xenografts.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Cell transplantation may be an attractive therapeutic approach for MS which may promote remyelination and suppress the inflammatory process. Neural precursor cells are promising in transplantation strategies to treat an injury to the CNS, because of their ability to differentiate into neural cells. Here, we investigated the use of polylactic acid/chitosan (PLA/CS) scaffold as 3D system which increases neural cell differentiation. Nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and conditioned media were employed to induce PC12 cells into neural-like cells (NLCs) on nanofibrous PLA/CS scaffold. Enhanced numbers of neural structures and staining of nestin, microtubule-associated protein (Map2), and class III \u5c3e-tubulin (\u5c3e3-tub) were observed with PC12-cell-seeded nanofibrous scaffolds when compared with control medium. The results revealed that PC12 cells attach, grow, and undergo differentiation on the nanofibrous PLA/CS scaffold. Additionally, our study illustrates that transplanted PC12-derived NLCs into the brain lateral ventricles of mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, significantly reduced the clinical signs of EAE. Histological examination showed attenuation of the inflammatory process in transplanted animals, which was correlated with the reduction of both axonal damage and demyelination.",

We attach antigens onto bundled carbon nanotubes and combined this complex with polymer nanoparticles containing magnetite and the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2). The number of T cells obtained was comparable to clinical standards using a thousand-fold less soluble IL-2. T cells obtained from this expansion were able to delay tumour growth in a murine model for melanoma. Our results show that this composite is a useful platform for generating large numbers of cytotoxic T cells for cancer immunotherapy.",

However, there are several outstanding issues, which need to be investigated: most notably donor cell engraftment and the subsequent selective expansion of transplanted cells. This protocol describes the preconditioning of the liver in a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV(-))-deficient rat model of efficient repopulation utilizing a selective external beam irradiation technique combined with regional transient portal ischemia (RTPI). Irradiation of the host liver impairs endogenous cell division, and the subsequent RTPI constitutes a strongly proliferative stimulus. Transplanted cells benefit from this stimulus, whereas endogenous cells have no ability to respond, due to a reduction in the mitotic capacity of the host liver. As described here, an effective preparative regime for liver repopulation is external beam liver irradiation in the form of a single dose of 25 Gy applied to the whole organ followed (4 days later) by RTPI of the right liver lobes lasting 90 min. After 1 h of reperfusion, the donor hepatocytes may be transplanted directly into the spleen as implantation site for further redistribution into the portal system and liver. This preparative regime certainly has the potential to be implemented in the clinic, since neither toxins nor highly potent carcinogens are used.",

Stage (S) 7 cells expressed key markers of mature pancreatic beta cells, including MAFA, and displayed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion similar to that of human islets during static incubations in vitro. Additional characterization using single-cell imaging and dynamic glucose stimulation assays revealed similarities but also notable differences between S7 insulin-secreting cells and primary human beta cells. Nevertheless, S7 cells rapidly reversed diabetes in mice within 40 days, roughly four times faster than pancreatic progenitors. Therefore, although S7 cells are not fully equivalent to mature beta cells, their capacity for glucose-responsive insulin secretion and rapid reversal of diabetes in vivo makes them a promising alternative to pancreatic progenitor cells or cadaveric islets for the treatment of diabetes.",

It has become clear that they represent a heterogeneous population of endothelial colony-forming cells, early or late outgrowth endothelial cells, or blood outgrowth endothelial cells, each characterized by differing proliferative and regenerative capacity. Scattered within the vascular wall, these cells participate in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis and support regeneration of epithelial cells. There is growing evidence that this cell population is impaired during the course of chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease when it undergoes premature senescence and loss of specialized functions. Senescence-associated secretory products released by such cells can affect the neighboring cells and further exacerbate their regenerative capacity. For these reasons, adoptive transfer of endothelial progenitor cells is being used in more than 150 ongoing clinical trials of diverse cardiovascular diseases. Attempts to rejuvenate this cell population either ex vivo or in situ are emerging. The progress in this field is paramount to regenerate the injured kidney.",

        "abstract": "Although Fasudil has shown therapeutic potential in EAE mice, the mechanism of action are still not fully understood. Here, we examined the immunomodulatory effect of Fasudil on encephalitogenic mononuclear cells (MNCs), and tested the therapeutic potential of Fasudil-treated MNCs in active EAE. Fasudil inhibited expression of CCL20 on T cells and migration of T cells, decreased CD4(+) IFN-\u7eac(+) and CD4(+) IL-17(+) T cells, but increased CD4(+) IL-10(+) and CD4(+) TGF-\u5c3e(+) T cells. Fasudil reduced expression of CD16/32 and IL-12, while elevating expression of CD206, CD23, and IL-10. Fasudil also decreased levels of iNOS/NO, enhanced levels of Arg-1, and inhibited the TLR-4/NF-\u9b4fB signaling and TNF-\u4f2a, shifting M1 macrophage to M2 phenotype. These modulatory effects of Fasudil on T cells and macrophages were not altered by adding autoantigen MOG35-55 to the culture, i.e., autoantigen-independent. Further, we observed that, in vitro, Fasudil inhibited the capacity of encephalitogenic MNCs to adoptively transfer EAE and reduced TLR-4/p-NF-\u9b4fB/p65 and inflammatory cytokines in spinal cords. Importantly, Fasudil-treated encephalitogenic MNCs exhibited therapeutic potential when injected into actively induced EAE mice. Together, our results not only provide evidence that Fasudil mediates the polarization of macrophages and the regulation of T cells, but also reveal a novel strategy for cell therapy in MS.",

Using the transwell system, RGC survival and length/number of neurites were quantified in coculture with stem cells in the presence or absence of specific Fc-receptor inhibitors to determine the role of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, VEGF, GDNF, PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB/BB in stem cell-mediated RGC neuroprotection and neuritogenesis. Conditioned media, collected from cultured hDPSC/hBMSC/hAMSC, were assayed for the secreted growth factors detailed above using ELISA. PCR array determined the hDPSC, hBMSC and hAMSC expression of genes encoding 84 growth factors and receptors. The results demonstrated that hDPSC promoted significantly more neuroprotection and neuritogenesis of axotomised RGC than either hBMSC or hAMSC, an effect that was neutralized after the addition of specific Fc-receptor inhibitors. hDPSC secreted greater levels of various growth factors including NGF, BDNF and VEGF compared with hBMSC/hAMSC. The PCR array confirmed these findings and identified VGF as a novel potentially therapeutic hDPSC-derived neurotrophic factor (NTF) with significant RGC neuroprotective properties after coculture with axotomised RGC. In conclusion, hDPSC promoted significant multi-factorial paracrine-mediated RGC survival and neurite outgrowth and may be considered a potent and advantageous cell therapy for retinal nerve repair.",

        "abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T therapy) has shown dramatic efficacy in patients with circulating lymphoma. However, eradication of solid tumors with CAR-T therapy has not been reported yet to be efficacious. In solid tumors, stroma destruction, due to MHC-restricted cross-presentation of tumor antigens to T cells, may be essential. However, CAR-Ts recognize antigens in an MHC-independent manner on cancer cells but not stroma cells. In this report, we show how CAR-Ts can be engineered to eradicate large established tumors with provision of a suitable CD28 costimulatory signal. In an HER2-dependent tumor model, tumor rejection by HER2-specific CAR-Ts was associated with sustained influx and proliferation of the adoptively transferred T cells. Interestingly, tumor rejection did not involve natural killer cells but was associated instead with a marked increase in the level of M1 macrophages and a requirement for IFN\u7eac receptor expression on tumor stroma cells. Our results argue that CAR-T therapy is capable of eradicating solid tumors through a combination of antigen-independent stroma destruction and antigen-specific tumor cell targeting.",

We transplanted 4.0 x 10(8) neural stem cells per procedure into the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture 7 days after cerebral hemorrhage, twice a week, a total of 4 times. NIHSS scores and brain CT scans were conducted to assess neural functions and the volume of perihematoma lesions in patients on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. We found that the NIHSS scores and the volume of the perihematoma lesions were significantly reduced after day 14. The differences before and after treatment were highly significant in intra- and between-group comparisons (P < 0.05). There were no adverse reactions, except for transient fever and shivering in a few patients. Our data suggest that the use of neural stem cells in intrathecal transplantation for the treatment of cerebral hemorrhage is safe and effective.",

        "abstract": "As a main contributing factor to low back pain, intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the fundamental basis for various debilitating spinal diseases. The pros and cons of current treatment modalities necessitate biological treatment strategies targeting for reversing or altering the degeneration process in terms of molecules or genes. The advances in stem cell research facilitate the studies aiming for possible clinical application of stem cell therapies for IDD. Human NP cells are versatile with cell morphology full of variety, capable of synthesizing extracellular matrix components, engulfing substances by autophagy and phagocytosis, mitochondrial vacuolization indicating dysfunction, expressing Fas and FasL as significant omens of immune privileged sites. Human discs belong to immune privilege organs with functional FasL expression, which can interact with invasive immune cells by Fas-FasL regulatory machinery. IDD is characterized by decreased expression level of FasL with dysfunctional FasL, which in turn unbalances the interaction between NP cells and immune cells. Certain modulation factors might play a role in the process, such as miR-155. Accumulating evidence indicates that Fas-FasL network expresses in a variety of stem cells. Given the expression of functional FasL and insensitive Fas in stem cells (we term as FasL privilege), transplantation of stem cells into the disc may regenerate the degenerative disc by not only differentiating into NP-like cells, increasing extracellular matrix, but also reinforce immune privilege via interaction with immune cells by Fas-FasL network.",

        "abstract": "The environment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is hypoxic, which plays an important role in maintaining their self-renewal potential and undifferentiated state. MSCs have been proven to possess immunomodulatory properties and have been used clinically to treat autoimmune diseases. Here, we tested the effects of hypoxia on the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs and examined its possible underlying mechanisms. We found that hypoxic stimulation promoted the immunomodulatory properties of human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) by enhancing the suppressive effects of hGMSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The proliferation of PBMCs was significantly inhibited, while the apoptosis of PBMCs was increased, which was associated with the Fas ligand (FasL) expression of hGMSCs. The in vivo study showed that systemically infused hGMSCs could enhance skin wound repair, and 24-h hypoxic stimulation significantly promoted the reparative capacity of hGMSCs. For mechanism, hGMSC treatment inhibited the local inflammation of injured skin by suppressing the inflammatory cells, reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u4f2a (TNF-\u4f2a), and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which was promoted by hypoxia. Hypoxia preconditioning may be a good optimizing method to promote the potential of MSCs for the future cell-based therapy.",

Three-dimensional MSC spheroids may be derived from the self-assembly of individual MSCs grown on certain polymer membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the self-assembled ASC spheroids on chitosan-hyaluronan membranes expressed more cytokine genes (fibroblast growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) as well as migration-associated genes (chemokine [C-X-C motif] receptor type 4 and matrix metalloprotease 1) compared with ASC dispersed single cells grown on culture dish. To evaluate the in vivo effects of these spheroids, we applied ASC single cells and ASC spheroids in a designed rat skin repair model. Wounds of 15\u9225\u58dd\u693b\u20ac?5\u9225\u5875m were created on rat dorsal skin, where ASCs were administered and covered with hyaluronan gel/chitosan sponge to maintain a moist environment. Results showed that skin wounds treated with ASC spheroids had faster wound closure and a significantly higher ratio of angiogenesis. Tracking of fluorescently labeled ASCs showed close localization of ASC spheroids to microvessels, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis through paracrine effects. Based on the in vitro and in vivo results, the self-assembled ASC spheroids may be a promising cellular source for skin tissue engineering and wound regeneration.",

        "abstract": "An ultra scale-down method is described to determine the response of cells to recovery by dead-end (batch) centrifugation under commercially defined manufacturing conditions. The key variables studied are the cell suspension hold time prior to centrifugation, the relative centrifugal force (RCF), time of centrifugation, cell pellet resuspension velocities, and number of resuspension passes. The cell critical quality attributes studied are the cell membrane integrity and the presence of selected surface markers. Greater hold times and higher RCF values for longer spin times all led to the increased loss of cell membrane integrity. However, this loss was found to occur during intense cell resuspension rather than the preceding centrifugation stage. Controlled resuspension at low stress conditions below a possible critical stress point led to essentially complete cell recovery even at conditions of extreme centrifugation (e.g., RCF of 10000 g for 30 mins) and long (~2 h) holding times before centrifugation. The susceptibility to cell loss during resuspension under conditions of high stress depended on cell type and the age of cells before centrifugation and the level of matrix crosslinking within the cell pellet as determined by the presence of detachment enzymes or possibly the nature of the resuspension medium. Changes in cell surface markers were significant in some cases but to a lower extent than loss of cell membrane integrity.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the most common type of diabetes in children and adolescents. Diabetic subjects are more likely to experience a myocardial infarction compared to nondiabetic subjects. In recent years, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have received increasing attention from basic scientists and clinicians and hold promise for myocardial regeneration due to their unlimited proliferation potential and differentiation capacity. However, cardiomyogenesis of type 1 diabetic donor-derived iPSCs (T1DM-iPSCs) has not been investigated yet. The aim of the study was to comparatively analyze cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation capacity of nondiabetic donor-derived iPSCs (N-iPSCs) and T1DM-iPSCs. The differentiated CMs were confirmed by both expression of cardiac-specific markers and presence of cardiac action potential. Since mitochondrial bioenergetics is vital to every aspect of CM function, extracellular acidification rates and oxygen consumption rates were measured using Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. The results showed that N-iPSCs and T1DM-iPSCs demonstrated similar capacity of differentiation into spontaneously contracting CMs exhibiting nodal-, atrial-, or ventricular-like action potentials. Differentiation efficiency was up to 90%. In addition, the CMs differentiated from N-iPSCs and T1DM-iPSCs (N-iPSC-CMs and T1DM-iPSC-CMs, respectively) showed 1) well-regulated glucose utilization at the level of glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and 2) the ability to switch metabolic pathways independent of extracellular glucose concentration. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that T1DM-iPSCs can differentiate into functional CMs with well-regulated glucose utilization as shown in N-iPSCs, suggesting that T1DM-iPSC-CMs might be a promising autologous cell source for myocardial regeneration in type 1 diabetes patients.",

Although ongoing therapeutic strategies ameliorate symptoms and prolong life for patients with cardiovascular diseases, they do not solve the critical issue related to the loss of cardiac tissue. Accordingly, stem/progenitor cell therapy has emerged as a paramount approach for cardiac repair and regeneration. In this regard, c-kit(+) cells have animated much interest and controversy. These cells are self-renewing, clonogenic, and multipotent and display a noteworthy potential to differentiate into all cardiovascular lineages. However, their functional contribution to cardiomyocyte turnover is one of the centrally debated issues concerning their regenerative potential. Regardless, plentiful preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted which provide evidence for the capacity of c-kit(+) cells to improve cardiac function.

What advances does it highlight? This therapy may be a promising strategy to treat renovascular hypertension and its renal consequences in the near future. Renovascular hypertension induced by the two-kidney, one-clip technique is a renin-angiotensin system-dependent model that leads to renal vascular rarefaction, fibrosis and renal failure. Treatment of renovascular hypertension remains a challenge, and thus, new therapies are needed. In this report, we discuss the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells on the reconstruction of the renal parenchyma of the stenotic kidney to improve vascular rarefaction and fibrosis. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy prevented the progressive increase in systolic arterial pressure, reduced sympathetic hyperactivity, improved renal morphology, induced neovascularization and reduced fibrosis in stenotic kidneys. Although this therapy may be a promising strategy to treat renovascular hypertension and its renal consequences, further studies are necessary to improve the efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells.",

However, the route of stem cell delivery into the CNS remains a challenge: with systemic administration (e.g., intravenous injection), a fraction of cells may be trapped in other organs than the CNS, while direct CNS injections, e.g., intracerebroventricular or transcranial, are invasive. Intranasal (i.n.) delivery of stem cells, in contrast, can effectively bypass the blood-brain barrier, rapidly enter the CNS, and minimize systemic distribution. I.n. delivery of stem cells may therefore be a safe and non-invasive way of targeting the CNS and would thus be a promising therapeutic option for CNS disease.

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are immune privileged and a cell source for tissue repair. Previous studies showed that there is systemic mobilization of osteoblastic precursors to the fracture site. We hypothesized that both systemic and local administration of allogeneic MSCs may promote fracture healing. Bone marrow-derived MSCs and skin fibroblasts were isolated from GFP Sprague-Dawley rats, cultured, and characterized. Closed transverse femoral fracture with internal fixation was established in 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomly assigned into four groups receiving PBS injection, MSC systemic injection, fibroblast systemic injection, and MSC fracture site injection; 2 \u8133 10(6) cells were injected at 4 days after fracture. All animals were sacrificed at 5 weeks after fracture; examinations included weekly radiograph, micro-CT, mechanical testing, histology, immunohistochemistry, and double immunofluorescence. The callus size of MSC injection groups was significantly larger among all the groups. Radiographs and 3D reconstruction images showed that the fracture gaps united in the MSC injected groups, while gaps were still seen in the fibroblast and PBS injection groups. The mechanical properties were significantly higher in the MSC injection groups than those in the fibroblast and PBS groups, but no difference was found between the MSC local and systemic injection groups. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence demonstrated that GFP-positive MSCs were present in the callus in the MSC injection groups at 5 weeks after fracture, and some differentiated into osteoblasts. Quantitative analysis revealed the number of GFP-positive cells in the callus in the MSC systemic injection group was significantly lower than that of the MSC local injection group. The proportion of GFP osteoblasts in GFP-positive cells in the MSC systemic injection group was significantly lower than that of the MSC local injection group. These findings provide critical insight for developing MSC-based therapies, and systemic injection of allogeneic MSCs may be a novel treatment method for promoting fracture repair.",

        "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration is directly linked to chronic low back pain, a condition that affects multitudes of people world-wide and presents tremendous direct and indirect health costs. Water-loss, inflammation and disruption of the extracellular matrix ultimately result in loss of tissue function and associated pain. Cytokines present in degenerate tissue can upregulate protease activity and directly causes pain. Non-invasive therapies provide limited efficacy for pain management, and surgical intervention is therefore often required to treat chronic low back pain. Disc removal can offer immediate pain-relief, however degeneration of adjacent segments can occur and pain can return. To circumvent the caveats of recurring pain and invasive surgeries, stem cell therapy is currently being investigated as a promising means to repair degenerating discs. However, while initial studies have shown promise, few studies have addressed whether stem cell therapies can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment or whether cytokines can affect the ability of the implanted cells to repair damaged tissue. This review focuses briefly on mechanisms of disc degeneration, with more attention given to the role of inflammatory milieu in this process. Cytokine upregulation in disc degeneration, the potential role of toll-like receptor signaling, and effects of these inflammatory factors on stem cells will be discussed. We find that while stem cell differentiation can be negatively influenced by inflammatory cytokines, stem cells can potentially have antiinflammatory effects. We conclude that further investigation of stem cell interactions with the inflammatory microenvironment is required, and that priming of stem cells under various conditions may be necessary for optimal therapeutic value for intervertebral disc repair and pain reduction.",

When this was investigated in a pluripotent-stem-cell-based hematopoietic differentiation model, IL-3/G-CSF or IL-3/M-CSF exposure resulted in the continuous generation of myeloid cells from an intermediate myeloid-cell-forming complex containing CD34(+) clonogenic progenitor cells for more than 2 months. Whereas IL-3/G-CSF directed differentiation toward CD45(+)CD11b(+)CD15(+)CD16(+)CD66b(+) granulocytic cells of various differentiation stages up to a segmented morphology displaying the capacity of cytokine-directed migration, respiratory burst response, and neutrophil-extracellular-trap formation, exposure to IL-3/M-CSF resulted in CD45(+)CD11b(+)CD14(+)CD163(+)CD68(+) monocyte/macrophage-type cells capable of phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Hence, we show here that myeloid specification of human pluripotent stem cells by IL-3/G-CSF or IL-3/M-CSF allows for prolonged and large-scale production of myeloid cells, and thus is suited for cell-fate and disease-modeling studies as well as gene- and cell-therapy applications.",

We developed genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that expressed recombinant Atsttrin (named as MSC-Atsttrin). Expression levels of ADAMTS-5, MMP13, and iNOS of human chondrocytes were analyzed when cocultured with MSC-GFP/Atsttrin. OA animal models were induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection, and MSC-GFP/Atsttrin were injected into the articular cavity 1 week postsurgery. The results showed that MSC-Atsttrin significantly suppressed TNF\u4f2a-driven up-regulation of matrix proteases and inflammatory factors. Intra-articular injection of MSC-Atsttrin prevented the progression of degenerative changes in the surgically induced OA mouse model. Additionally, levels of detrimental matrix hydrolases were significantly diminished. Compared with nontreated OA samples at 8 weeks postsurgery, the percentages of MMP13- and ADAMTS-5-positive cells were significantly reduced from 91.33% \u5364 9.87% to 24.33% \u5364 5.7% (p < .001) and from 91.33% \u5364 7.1% to 16.67% \u5364 3.1% (p < .001), respectively. Our results thus indicated that suppression of TNF\u4f2a activity is an effective strategy for OA treatment and that intra-articular injection of MSCs-Atsttrin could be a promising therapeutic modality.",

However, the hepatic vasculature is not an optimal transplant site for several reasons, including graft attrition and the inability to retrieve or image the islets. Here we describe islet transplantation into a prevascularized, subcutaneous site created by temporary placement of a medically approved vascular access catheter. In mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, transplantation of \u922d?00 syngeneic islets into the resulting 'device-less' space reversed diabetes in 91% of mice and maintained normoglycemia for >100 days. The approach was also effective in mice with pre-existing diabetes, in another mouse strain that mounts a more vigorous inflammatory response, and across an allogeneic barrier. These results demonstrate that transient priming of a subcutaneous site supports diabetes-reversing islet transplantation in mouse models without the need for a permanent cell-encapsulation device.",

        "abstract": "Here, we describe a fatal serious adverse event observed in a patient infused with autologous T-cell receptor (TCR) transduced T cells. This TCR, originally obtained from a melanoma patient, recognizes the well-described HLA-A*0201 restricted 26-35 epitope of MART-1, and was not affinity enhanced. Patient 1 with metastatic melanoma experienced a cerebral hemorrhage, epileptic seizures, and a witnessed cardiac arrest 6 days after cell infusion. Three days later, the patient died from multiple organ failure and irreversible neurologic damage. After T-cell infusion, levels of IL-6, IFN-\u7eac, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin increased to extreme levels, indicative of a cytokine release syndrome or T-cell-mediated inflammatory response. Infused T cells could be recovered from blood, broncho-alveolar lavage, ascites, and after autopsy from tumor sites and heart tissue. High levels of NT-proBNP indicate semi-acute heart failure. No cross reactivity of the modified T cells toward a beating cardiomyocyte culture was observed. Together, these observations suggest that high levels of inflammatory cytokines alone or in combination with semi-acute heart failure and epileptic seizure may have contributed substantially to the occurrence of the acute and lethal event. Protocol modifications to limit the risk of T-cell activation-induced toxicity are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Despite the ability of antiretroviral therapy to minimize human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and increase the duration and quality of patients' lives, the health consequences and financial burden associated with the lifelong treatment regimen render a permanent cure highly attractive. Although T cells play an important role in controlling virus replication, they are themselves targets of HIV-mediated destruction. Direct genetic manipulation of T cells for adoptive cellular therapies could facilitate a functional cure by generating HIV-1-resistant cells, redirecting HIV-1-specific immune responses, or a combination of the two strategies. In contrast to a vaccine approach, which relies on the production and priming of HIV-1-specific lymphocytes within a patient's own body, adoptive T-cell therapy provides an opportunity to customize the therapeutic T cells prior to administration. However, at present, it is unclear how to best engineer T cells so that sustained control over HIV-1 replication can be achieved in the absence of antiretrovirals. This review focuses on T-cell gene-engineering and gene-editing strategies that have been performed in efforts to inhibit HIV-1 replication and highlights the requirements for a successful gene therapy-mediated functional cure.",

        "abstract": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) provide revascularisation for cardiovascular disease and the expansion of these cells opens up the possibility of their use as a cell therapy. Herein we show that interleukin-3 (IL3) strongly expands a population of human non-adherent endothelial forming cells (EXnaEFCs) with low immunogenicity as well as pro-angiogenic capabilities in vivo, making their therapeutic utilisation a realistic option. Non-adherent CD133(+) EFCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood and cultured under different conditions were maximally expanded by day 12 in the presence of IL3 at which time a 350-fold increase in cell number was obtained. Cell surface marker phenotyping confirmed expression of the hematopoietic progenitor cell markers CD133, CD117 and CD34, vascular cell markers VEGFR2 and CD31, dim expression of CD45 and absence of myeloid markers CD14 and CD11b. Functional experiments revealed that EXnaEFCs exhibited classical properties of endothelial cells (ECs), namely binding of Ulex europaeus lectin, up-take of acetylated-low density lipoprotein and contribution to EC tube formation in vitro. These EXnaEFCs demonstrated a pro-angiogenic phenotype within two independent in vivo rodent models. Firstly, a Matrigel plug assay showed increased vascularisation in mice. Secondly, a rat model of acute myocardial infarction demonstrated reduced heart damage as determined by lower levels of serum creatinine and a modest increase in heart functionality. Taken together, these studies show IL3 as a potent growth factor for human CD133(+) cell expansion with clear pro-angiogenic properties (in vitro and in vivo) and thus may provide clinical utility for humans in the future.",

        "abstract": "Tumor growth involves a dynamic interplay between cancer cells and host cells, which collectively form a tumor microenvironmental network that either suppresses or promotes tumor growth under different conditions. The transition from tumor suppression to tumor promotion is mediated by a tumor-induced shift in the local immune state, and despite the clinical challenge this shift poses, little is known about how such dysfunctional immune states are initiated. Clinical and experimental observations have indicated that differences in both the composition and spatial distribution of different cell types and/or signaling molecules within the tumor microenvironment can strongly impact tumor pathogenesis and ultimately patient prognosis. How such \"functional\" and \"spatial\" heterogeneities confer such effects, however, is not known. To investigate these phenomena at a level currently inaccessible by direct observation, we developed a computational model of a nascent metastatic tumor capturing salient features of known tumor-immune interactions that faithfully recapitulates key features of existing experimental observations. Surprisingly, over a wide range of model formulations, we observed that heterogeneity in both spatial organization and cell phenotype drove the emergence of immunosuppressive network states. We determined that this observation is general and robust to parameter choice by developing a systems-level sensitivity analysis technique, and we extended this analysis to generate other parameter-independent, experimentally testable hypotheses. Lastly, we leveraged this model as an in silico test bed to evaluate potential strategies for engineering cell-based therapies to overcome tumor associated immune dysfunction and thereby identified modes of immune modulation predicted to be most effective. Collectively, this work establishes a new integrated framework for investigating and modulating tumor-immune networks and provides insights into how such interactions may shape early stages of tumor formation.",

Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (P-CEF) were cultured and seeded on prepared acellular dermal matrix (ADM). A full thickness skin defect (20\u813320 mm(2)) was created in thirty-six rats and randomly divided into three equal groups. Defect was left open, repaired with ADM and ADM seeded with P-CEF (3-D ADM) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. By day 28, the treated wounds healed completely without scar. By day 7 hydroxyproline contents was higher in group 3 as compared to groups 1 and 2. There was slightly more B cell response in animals implanted with ADM and 3-D ADM. At day 21, stimulation index was lower with acellular dermis antigen as compared to 3-D ADM antigen. In group 1 on day 3, the granulation tissue showed more inflammatory reaction, fibroplasia and neovascularization as compared to group 2 and 3. By day 28, there was complete epithelization was observed in all groups over. However, a large scar was observed in group 1. The graft was completely absorbed and replaced with densely thick and best arranged collagen fibers. On day 7, malonyldialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly (P<0.05) increased in group 1. Reduced glutathione values increased and reached to near normal in groups 2 and 3. Catalase values were significantly (P<0.05) higher in group 1 at different time intervals. SEM samples of group 2 showed ingrowth of fibroblasts into acellular matrix at host graft junction. However, in group 3 fibroblasts were infiltrated within the pores of graft. It was concluded that P-CEF cells seeded ADM facilitated early and better healing.",

        "abstract": "The toxicities of immunotherapy for cancer are as diverse as the type of treatments that have been devised. These range from cytokine therapies that induce capillary leakage to vaccines associated with low levels of autoimmunity to cell therapies that can induce damaging cross-reactivity with normal tissue to checkpoint protein inhibitors that induce immune-related adverse events that are autoinflammatory in nature. The thread that ties these toxicities together is their mechanism-based immune nature and the T-cell-mediated adverse events seen. The basis for the majority of these adverse events is a hyperactivated T-cell response with reactivity directed against normal tissue, resulting in the generation of high levels of CD4 T-helper cell cytokines or increased migration of cytolytic CD8 T cells within normal tissues. The T-cell immune response is not tissue specific and may reflect a diffuse expansion of the T-cell repertoire that induces cross-reactivity with normal tissue, effectively breaking tolerance that is active with cytokines, vaccines, and checkpoint protein inhibitors and passive in the case of adoptive cell therapy. Cytokines seem to generate diffuse and nonspecific T-cell reactivity, whereas checkpoint protein inhibition, vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy seem to activate more specific T cells that interact directly with normal tissues, potentially causing specific organ damage. In this review, we summarize the toxicities that are unique to immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to familiarize the oncology practitioner with the spectrum of adverse events seen with newly approved and emerging modalities.",

Therefore, we explored whether transplantation of hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could ameliorate inherited liver diseases. iPSCs reprogrammed from human skin fibroblasts were differentiated to iHeps, which were transplanted into livers of uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase-1 (UGT1A1)-deficient Gunn rats, a model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome 1 (CN1), where elevated unconjugated bilirubin causes brain injury and death. To promote iHep proliferation, 30% of the recipient liver was X-irradiated before transplantation, and hepatocyte growth factor was expressed. After transplantation, UGT1A1+ iHep clusters constituted 2.5%-7.5% of the preconditioned liver lobe. A decline of serum bilirubin by 30%-60% and biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides indicated that transplanted iHeps expressed UGT1A1 activity, a postnatal function of hepatocytes. Therefore, iHeps warrant further exploration as a renewable source of hepatocytes for treating inherited liver diseases.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss in several regions of the brain. Recent studies have suggested that stem cell transplantation could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to halt or ameliorate the inexorable disease progression. However, the optimal stage of the disease for stem cell transplantation to have a therapeutic effect has yet to be determined. Here, we demonstrated that transplantation of neural stem cells into 12-month-old Tg2576 brains markedly improved both cognitive impairments and neuropathological features by reducing \u5c3e-amyloid processing and upregulating clearance of \u5c3e-amyloid, secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, endogenous neurogenesis, as well as synapse formation. In contrast, the stem cell transplantation did not recover cognitive dysfunction and \u5c3e-amyloid neuropathology in Tg2576 mice aged 15 months when the memory loss is manifest. Overall, this study underscores that stem cell therapy at optimal time frame is crucial to obtain maximal therapeutic effects that can restore functional deficits or stop the progression of AD.",

        "abstract": "Degeneration or loss of GABAergic neurons frequently may lead to many neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders. So far no clinically effective therapies can slow and halt the progression of these diseases. Cell-replacement therapy is a promising strategy for treatment of these neuropsychiatric diseases. Although increasing evidence showed that mammalian somatic cells can be directly converted into functional neurons using specific transcription factors or miRNAs via virus delivery, the application of these induced neurons is potentially problematic, due to integration of vectors into the host genome, which results in the disruption or dysfunction of nearby genes. Here, we show that mouse fibroblasts could be efficiently reprogrammed into GABAergic neurons in a combined medium composed of conditioned medium from neurotrophin-3 modified Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (NT3-OECs) plus SB431542, GDNF and RA. Following 3 weeks of induction, these cells derived from fibroblasts acquired the morphological and phenotypical GABAerigic neuronal properties, as demonstrated by the expression of neuronal markers including Tuj1, NeuN, Neurofilament-L, GABA, GABA receptors and GABA transporter 1. More importantly, these converted cells acquired neuronal functional properties such as synapse formation and increasing intracellular free calcium influx when treated with BayK, a specific activator of L-type calcium channel. Therefore, our findings demonstrate for the first time that fibroblasts can be directly converted into GABAergic neurons without ectopic expression of specific transcription factors or miRNA. This study may provide a promising cell source for the application of cell replacement therapy in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "High glucose-insulted bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMCs) showed impaired angiogenesis along with downregulation of stem cell factor (SCF). This study was designed to determine the involvement of microRNAs (miR), which are actively involved in the physiological function of stem cells. We observed that miR-34c was significantly induced by high glucose treatment and blunted tube formation of BMCs. Stem cell factor (SCF) was confirmed as a target of miR-34c by 3'-UTR promoter analysis and Western blot. SCF knockdown by siRNA induced Kr\u7709ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and resulted in the blockade of angiogenesis of BMCs. Sequentially, KLF4 overexpression completely blocked tube formation through inducing PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). To study the action of miR-34c in terms of the therapeutic potential of BMCs, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ligation of the coronary artery in nude mice, BMCs transfected with miR-control or miR-34c were injected into the infarcted myocardium 7 days later, and histological studies were performed 2 weeks later. Cardiac fibrosis was 18.24\u53644.7% in the miR-34c-BMC group and 10.01\u53640.2% in the miR-control-BMC group (p<0.05). Cardiac function and vessel density were decreased in the miR-34c-BMC group compared with the miR-con-BMC group. Particularly, miR-34c-BMCs failed to incorporate into vessels. Our results show that the angiogenic activity of BMCs is finely regulated by the miR-34c-SCF-KLF4 axis, which is a potent translational target for optimizing the therapeutic activity of autologous BMCs for cardiac repair.",

Circulating EPCs can be directly recruited to some extent at sites of injury, and their administration could accelerate repair or endothelialization of the damaged tissue. We investigated the effects of intracavernous injections of EPCs into the corpora cavernosa of rats with erectile dysfunction (ED) caused by bilateral cavernous nerve (CN) injury. Overall, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: sham surgery, vehicle-only, or EPC treatment. Rats in the EPC treatment and vehicle-only groups were subjected to bilateral CN injury before injection of EPCs or vehicle, respectively, into the corpora cavernosa. Four weeks after surgery, erectile function was assessed by measuring maximum intracavernosal pressure (ICP), change in ICP, area under the ICP curve, and ratio of change in ICP and mean arterial pressure (MAP; \u8796ICP/MAP). Penile tissue was histomorphometrically analyzed for the expression of neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), neurofilament-1 (NF-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and smooth muscle cell content. Maximum ICP and all other functional parameters of erectile function were significantly reduced in the vehicle-only group vs. the sham and EPC treatment groups (all p\u807d<\u807d0.001). Smooth muscle cell content was decreased in the vehicle-only vs. the sham and EPC treatment groups (both p\u807d<\u807d0.01). Expressions of vWF and eNOS in the dorsal artery were significantly higher in the EPC treatment than the vehicle-only group (p\u807d<\u807d0.05). In conclusion, EPC treatment restored erectile function in a rat model of bilateral CN injury through recruitment of EPCs toward the dorsal artery and preservation of smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum. These findings elucidate the therapeutic potential of EPCs for treating ED in humans.",

        "abstract": "One of the major hurdles in liver gene and cell therapy is availability of ex vivo-expanded hepatocytes. Pluripotent stem cells are an attractive alternative. Here, we show that hepatocyte precursors can be isolated from male germline cell-derived pluripotent stem cells (GPSCs) using the hepatoblast marker, Liv2, and induced to differentiate into hepatocytes in vitro. These cells expressed hepatic-specific genes and were functional as demonstrated by their ability to secrete albumin and produce urea. When transplanted in the liver parenchyma of partially hepatectomised mice, Liv2-sorted cells showed regional and heterogeneous engraftment in the injected lobe. Moreover, approximately 50% of Y chromosome-positive, GPSC-derived cells were found in the female livers, in the region of engraftment, even one month after cell injection. This is the first study showing that Liv2-sorted GPSCs-derived hepatocytes can undergo long lasting engraftment in the mouse liver. Thus, GPSCs might offer promise for regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal muscle tissue engineering is one of the important ways for regenerating functionally defective muscles. Among the myopathies, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disease due to mutations of the dystrophin gene leading to progressive myofiber degeneration with severe symptoms. Although current therapies in muscular dystrophy are still very challenging, important progress has been made in materials science and in cellular technologies with the use of stem cells. It is therefore useful to review these advances and the results obtained in a clinical point of view. This article focuses on the differentiation of stem cells into myoblasts, and their application in muscular dystrophy. After an overview of the different stem cells that can be induced to differentiate into the myogenic lineage, we introduce scaffolding materials used for muscular tissue engineering. We then described some widely used methods to differentiate different types of stem cell into myoblasts. We highlight recent insights obtained in therapies for muscular dystrophy. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on stem cell technology. We discussed in parallel the benefits brought by the evolution of the materials and by the expansion of cell sources which can differentiate into myoblasts. We also discussed on future challenges for clinical applications and how to accelerate the translation from the research to the clinic in the frame of DMD.",

There have been many recent developments in cell-based therapy (CBT) to replace lost circuitry and provide chronic biological sources of therapeutic agents to the PD-affected brain. Early neural transplantation studies underscored the challenges of immune compatibility, graft integration and the need for renewable, autologous graft sources. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) offer a potential class of cytoprotective pharmacotherapeutics that may complement dopamine (DA) replacement and CBT strategies in PD. Chronic NTF delivery may be an integral goal of CBT, with grafts consisting of autologous drug-producing (e.g., DA, NTF) cells that are capable of integration and function in the host brain. In this mini-review, we outline the past experience and recent advances in NTF technology and CBT as promising and integrated approaches for the treatment of PD.",

This study was performed to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) could exhibit therapeutic effects on human silicosis. This non-randomized uncontrolled trial comprised four patients with pulmonary silicosis who had developed lung fibrosis and received autologous bone marrow MSCs previously transfected by a vector containing human HGF cDNA (MSCs/HGF). MSCs/HGF were intravenously administered weekly for three consecutive weeks at a dose of 2 x 10(6) cells/kg. Pulmonary function, high kilo-voltage chest X-ray radiography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset and serum IgG concentrations were evaluated after cell therapy. The treatment was found to be generally safe. Symptoms such as cough and chest distress gradually ameliorated at six months post-therapy, accompanied by the significant improvement of pulmonary function. The ratios of the peripheral CD4- and CD8- positive cell concentrations were increased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the serum IgG levels in these patients were decreased and reached the normal range (P < 0.05). CT scans showed partial absorption of the nodular and reticulonodular lesions in the lungs during follow-up of at least 12 months. The effectiveness of this novel regimen observed in these patients suggests that a placebo-controlled clinical trial needs to be developed.

Tissue engineering-based therapy is potentially a less invasive and more effective therapeutic modality. We recently started a first-in-man clinical trial of cell-based therapy for treating corneal endothelial dysfunction in Japan. However, the senescence of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) during the serial passage culture needed to obtain massive quantities of cells for clinical use is a serious technical obstacle preventing the push of this regenerative therapy to clinical settings. Here, we show evidence from an animal model confirming that senescent cells are less effective in cell therapy. In addition, we propose that density-gradient centrifugation can eliminate the senescent cells and purify high potency CECs for clinical use. This simple technique might be applicable for other types of cells in the settings of regenerative medicine.",

They can be used in the laboratory to model the pathophysiology of human kidney disease, and have the potential to establish a new area of immunocompatible, on-demand renal transplantation. Critical challenges remain before the full potential of these cells can be accurately assessed. We need to understand whether the derived cell types are mature and can replace kidney function(s). To what extent can iPS cells model kidney disease in the simplified environment of cell culture? Ultimately, successful integration of these cells as autograft therapies will require demonstration of safety and efficacy equal or superior to the existing gold standards of kidney allograft transplantation and dialysis. Specific educational and infrastructural changes will be necessary if these specialized technologies are to be adopted as an accepted modalities in clinical medicine. Given these barriers, the first fruit of these labors is likely to be improved understanding of pathophysiological pathways in human IPS cell disease models, followed by drug discovery and testing. These experiments will lead naturally to improvements in differentiation and experiments in animal models testing function. The time course to achieve the desired goals remains unknown, but the ultimate hope is that new, more effective and less expensive modalities for renal replacement therapy will occur in the foreseeable future.

        "abstract": "The actin motor protein non-muscle myosin II (NMII) acts as a master regulator of cell morphology, with a role in several essential cellular processes, including cell migration and post-synaptic dendritic spine plasticity in neurons. NMII also generates forces that alter biochemical signaling, by driving changes in interactions between actin-associated proteins that can ultimately regulate gene transcription. In addition to its roles in normal cellular physiology, NMII has recently emerged as a critical regulator of diverse, genetically complex diseases, including neuronal disorders, cancers and vascular disease. In the context of these disorders, NMII regulatory pathways can be directly mutated or indirectly altered by disease-causing mutations. NMII regulatory pathway genes are also increasingly found in disease-associated copy-number variants, particularly in neuronal disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Furthermore, manipulation of NMII-mediated contractility regulates stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, thus highlighting the key role of NMII-based pharmaceuticals in the clinical success of stem cell therapies. In this Review, we discuss the emerging role of NMII activity and its regulation by kinases and microRNAs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of a diverse range of diseases, including neuronal disorders, cancer and vascular disease. We also address promising clinical applications and limitations of NMII-based inhibitors in the treatment of these diseases and the development of stem-cell-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is a major health problem in the world, and scientists seek innovative treatment strategies with higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the existing therapeutic agents. In this way, stem cell researchers try to reveal new pathways that will eventually benefit patients. Stem cell research has proven that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess anticancer activities, and their protein-rich secretome showed similar effects. MSCs also secrete cytokines that play an active role in healing and regeneration processes. Because of their known plasticity, MSCs display a variety of characteristics and functions in different environments, depending on their interactions with various cell types and tissues. Therefore, we hypothesize that MSC therapy in combination with anticancer medicines can potentiate cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. In addition, because of their regenerative capacity, MSCs can protect normal tissues from adverse cytotoxic drug reactions. They may also help rescue injured tissues from these toxic damages or systemic pathological events that occur during cancer treatment. MSC therapy may double the beneficial effects on cancer and normal cells. As our knowledge of systems biology and biotechnological methodology is progressing, this idea can move forward as a treatment option.",

        "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The increasing interest in newborn screening procedures for LSDs underlines the need for alternative cellular and gene therapy approaches to be developed during the perinatal period, supporting the treatment of MPS patients before the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. The rationale for considering these early therapies results from the clinical experience in the treatment of MPSs and other genetic disorders. The normal or gene-corrected hematopoiesis transplanted in patients can produce the missing protein at levels sufficient to improve and/or halt the disease-related abnormalities. However, these current therapies are only partially successful, probably due to the limited efficacy of the protein provided through the hematopoiesis. An alternative explanation is that the time at which the cellular or gene therapy procedures are performed could be too late to prevent pre-existing or progressive organ damage. Considering these aspects, in the last several years, novel cellular and gene therapy approaches have been tested in different animal models at birth, a highly early stage, showing that precocious treatment is critical to prevent long-term pathological consequences. This review provides insights into the state-of-art accomplishments made with neonatal cellular and gene-based therapies and the major barriers that need to be overcome before they can be implemented in the medical community.",

        "abstract": "In the current study, we sought to identify bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) subpopulations associated with a combined improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and maximal oxygen consumption (VO max) in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy 6 months after receiving transendocardial injections of autologous BM-MNCs or placebo. For this prospectively planned analysis, we conducted an embedded cohort study comprising 78 patients from the FOCUS-Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) trial. Baseline BM-MNC immunophenotypes and progenitor cell activity were determined by flow cytometry and colony-forming assays, respectively. Previously stable patients who demonstrated improvement in LVEF, LVESV, and VO max during the 6-month course of the FOCUS-CCTRN study (group 1, n\u9225?\u9225?7) were compared to those who showed no change or worsened in one to three of these endpoints (group 2, n\u9225?\u9225?1) and to a subset of patients from group 2 who declined in all three functional endpoints (group 2A, n\u9225?\u9225?1). Group 1 had higher frequencies of B-cell and CXCR4 BM-MNC subpopulations at study baseline than group 2 or 2A. Furthermore, patients in group 1 had fewer endothelial colony-forming cells and monocytes/macrophages in their bone marrow than those in group 2A. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, certain bone marrow-derived cell subsets are associated with improvement in LVEF, LVESV, and VO max at 6 months. These results suggest that the presence of both progenitor and immune cell populations in the bone marrow may influence the natural history of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy-even in stable patients. Thus, it may be important to consider the bone marrow composition and associated regenerative capacity of patients when assigning them to treatment groups and evaluating the results of cell therapy trials.",

Therefore the appearance and function restoration has become an imperative in tissue engineering research. In this study, cell-aggregates constructed with green fluorescent protein-expressing (GFP(+)) rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were applied to rat acute full-layer cutaneous wound model to confirm its pro-regeneration ability and compare its regenerative efficacy with the currently thriving subcutaneous and intravenous stem cell administration strategy, with a view to sensing the advantages, disadvantages and the mechanism behind. According to results, cell-aggregates cultured in vitro enjoyed higher expression of several pro-healing genes than adherent cultured cells. Animal experiments showed better vascularization along with more regular dermal collagen deposition for cell-aggregate transplanted models. Immunofluorescence staining on inflammatory cells indicated a shorter inflammatory phase for cell-aggregate group, which was backed up by further RT-PCR. The in situ immunofluorescence staining manifested a higher GFP(+)-cell engraftment for cell-aggregate transplanted models versus cell administered ones. Thus it is safe to say the BMMSCs aggregate could bring superior cutaneous regeneration for full layer cutaneous wound to BMMSCs administration, both intravenous and subcutaneous.",

Three hundred eighteen teams from 31 countries responded to the cellular and engineered tissue therapy survey; 145 teams from 25 countries reported treating 2187 patients, while a further 173 teams reported no activity. Indications were musculoskeletal/rheumatological disorders (45%; 89% autologous), cardiovascular disorders (20%; 99% autologous), hematology/oncology, predominantly prevention or treatment of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and HSC graft enhancement, (19%; <1% autologous), neurological disorders (3%; 100% autologous), gastrointestinal disorders (2%; 32% autologous), and other indications (11%; 67% autologous). The majority of autologous cells (88%) were used to treat musculoskeletal/rheumatological (57%) and cardiovascular (27%) disorders, whereas allogeneic cells were used mainly for hematology/oncology (64%). The reported cell types were mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) (49%), HSC (28%), chondrocytes (11%), dendritic cells (2%), keratinocytes (1%), and others (9%). In 46% of the grafts, cells were delivered following ex vivo expansion, sorted in 17% of the reported cases and transduced in only 3%. Thirty three percent of treatments were delivered intravenously or intra-arterially, and of the remaining 67%, 37% used a membrane/scaffold, 28% a suspension, and 2% a gel. The data are compared to those previously collected to identify trends in a still unpredictably evolving field.",

        "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder in which an abnormally expanded polyglutamine tract is inserted into causative ataxin-1 proteins. We have previously shown that SCA1 knockin (SCA1-KI) mice over 6 months of age exhibit a degeneration of motor neuron axons and their encasing myelin sheaths, as reported in SCA1 patients. We examined whether axon degeneration precedes myelin degeneration or vice versa in SCA1-KI mice and then attempted to mitigate motor neuron degeneration by intrathecally administering mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Temporal examination of the diameters of motor neuron axons and their myelin sheaths revealed a decrease in diameter of the axon but not of the myelin sheaths in SCA1-KI mice as early as 1 month of age, which suggests secondary degeneration of the myelin sheaths. We injected MSCs into the intrathecal space of SCA1-KI mice at 1 month of age, which resulted in a significant suppression of degeneration of both motor neuron axons and myelin sheaths, even 6 months after the MSC injection. Thus, MSCs effectively suppressed peripheral nervous system degeneration in SCA1-KI mice. It has not yet been clarified how clinically administered MSCs exhibit significant therapeutic effects in patients with SCA1. The morphological evidence presented in this current mouse study might explain the mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of MSCs that are observed in patients with SCA1.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mouse clonal bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) obtained from a single colony by using subfractionation culturing method for erectile function in diabetic animals. Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: controls, diabetic mice, and diabetic mice treated with a single intracavernous injection of PBS (20 \u6e2dL) or clonal BMSCs (3 \u8133 10(5) cells/20 \u6e2dL). Clonal BMSCs were isolated from 5-week-old C3H mice. Two weeks after treatment, erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve. The penis was stained with antibodies to PECAM-1, smooth muscle \u4f2a-actin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), neurofilament, and phosphorylated endothelial NOS (phospho-eNOS). We also performed Western blot for phospho-eNOS, and eNOS in the corpus cavernosum tissue. Local delivery of clonal BMSCs significantly restored cavernous endothelial and smooth muscle cell contents, and penile nNOS and neurofilament contents, and induced eNOS phosphorylation (Ser1177) in diabetic mice. Intracavernous injection of clonal BMSCs induced significant recovery of erectile function, which reached 80-90% of the control values. Clonal BMSCs successfully restored erectile function through dual angiogenic and neurotrophic effects in diabetic mice. The homogenous nature of clonal mesenchymal stem cells may allow their clinical applications and open a new avenue through which to treat diabetic erectile dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Single-vessel, intracoronary infusion of stem cells under stop-flow conditions has proven safe but achieves only limited myocardial coverage. Continuous flow intracoronary delivery to one or more coronary vessels may achieve broader coverage for treating cardiomyopathy, but has not been investigated. Using nonocclusive coronary guiding catheters, we infused allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) either in a single vessel or sequentially in all three coronary arteries in porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess structural and physiological outcomes. Vehicle-infused animals served as controls. Single-vessel stop-flow and continuous-flow intracoronary infusion revealed equivalent effects on scar size and function. Sequential infusion into each of the three major coronary vessels under stop-flow or continuous-flow conditions revealed equal efficacy, but less elevation of necrotic biomarkers with continuous-flow delivery. In addition, multi-vessel delivery resulted in enhanced global and regional tissue function compared to a triple-vessel placebo-treated group. The functional benefits after global cell infusion were accompanied histologically by minimal inflammatory cellular infiltration, attenuated regional fibrosis and enhanced vessel density in the heart. Sequential multi-vessel non-occlusive delivery of CDCs is safe and provides enhanced preservation of left ventricular function and structure. The current findings provide preclinical validation of the delivery method currently undergoing clinical testing in the Dilated cardiomYopathy iNtervention With Allogeneic MyocardIally-regenerative Cells (DYNAMIC) trial of CDCs in heart failure patients.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL8) is highly expressed by injured arteries in a variety of diseases and is a chemoattractant for neutrophils which express IL8 receptors IL8RA and RB (IL8RA/B) on their membranes. Neutrophils interact with the damaged endothelium and initiate an inflammatory cascade at the site of injury. We have generated a novel translational targeted cell therapy for acute vascular injury using adenoviral vectors to overexpress IL8RA/B and green fluorescent protein (GFP) on the surface of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs). We hypothesize that HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs transfused intravenously into rats with balloon injury of the carotid artery will target to the injured site and compete with neutrophils, thus inhibiting inflammation and neointima formation. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent balloon injury of the right carotid artery and received intravenous transfusion of saline vehicle, 1.5 \u8133 10(6) HiPS-ECs, 1.5 \u8133 10(6) HiPS-Null-ECs, or 1.5 \u8133 10(6) HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs immediately after endoluminal injury. Tissue distribution of HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs was analyzed by a novel GFP DNA qPCR method. Cytokine and chemokine expression and leukocyte infiltration were measured in injured and uninjured arteries at 24 h postinjury by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Neointimal, medial areas, and reendothelialization were measured 14 days postinjury. HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs homed to injured arteries, inhibited inflammatory mediator expression and inflammatory cell infiltration, accelerated reendothelialization, and attenuated neointima formation after endoluminal injury while control HiPS-ECs and HiPS-Null-ECs did not. HiPS-IL8RA/B-ECs transfused into rats with endoluminal carotid artery injury target to the injured artery and provide a novel strategy to treat vascular injury.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of activated nucleus pulposus (NP) cells obtained by coculturing NP cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells having cell-to-cell contact has been shown to be effective in animal models and, more recently, in human clinical trials. If the NP cells can be cryopreserved, then autologous cell transplantation could be offered to patients as and when required. In a previous study, we confirmed that activated NP cells can be obtained by coculturing with mesenchymal cells after cryopreservation. However, the in vivo effects of cell transplantation therapy using activated NP cells prepared from cryopreserved cells are not known. In this in vivo canine model, we compared indicators of disc degeneration in animals that received transplanted activated normal NP cells, transplanted cryopreserved NP cells, and no cell transplantation after induction of disc degeneration. The intervertebral disc height on radiographs and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were significantly higher in both cell transplantation groups compared with the degenerated disc group. Macroscopic and histological findings demonstrated attenuated disc degeneration in the two transplanted groups. Intense staining of proteoglycan and collagen type II was seen in green fluorescent protein-labelled transplanted cells, which suggested that the cells had survived and were functioning after transplantation. No significant differences were observed between the two transplanted groups. Transplanted activated cryopreserved NP cells induced a similar attenuation of intervertebral disc degeneration as that of conventionally activated NP cells. These findings suggest that the use of cryopreserved cells specific to a patient's condition has potential in transplantation therapy.",

Although most of the current expansion protocols for ASCs use fetal calf serum (FCS), xenogeneic-free medium supplements are greatly desired. This study aims to compare the effect of FCS, human platelet lysate (hPL), and a fully defined medium on the initiation and maintenance of ASC cultures. ASCs obtained from five donors were cultured in five different media: StemPro, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% hPL, or \u4f2a-minimum essential medium (A-MEM) supplemented with 5% hPL, 10% hPL, or 10% FCS. The effect of media on proliferation, colony-forming units (CFUs), attachment, and morphology was assessed along with cell size, granularity, and immunophenotype. StemPro greatly compromised the initiation of ASC cultures, which could not survive more than a few passages. Cells cultured in A-MEM proliferated at a faster rate than in DMEM, and hPL significantly enhanced cell size, granularity, and proliferation compared with FCS. All media except StemPro supported CFUs equally well. Analysis of surface markers revealed higher levels of CD73 and CD105 in FCS-cultured ASCs, whereas increased levels of CD146 were found in hPL-cultured cells. Multiparametric flow cytometric analysis performed after seven passages revealed the existence of four distinct ASC subpopulations, all positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105, which mainly differed by their expression of CD146 and CD271. Analysis of the different subpopulations might represent an important biological measure when assessing different medium formulations for a particular clinical application.",

In a series of intervention trials, systemic administration of TNF-expressing tumor cells was associated with reduced growth of both primary tumors and metastatic colonies in immunocompetent mice. We show that these malignant cells home to tumors, locally release TNF, damage neovascular endothelium, and induce massive cancer cell apoptosis. We also demonstrate that such tumor-cell-mediated delivery avoids or minimizes common side effects often associated with TNF-based therapy, such as acute inflammation and weight loss. Our study provides proof of concept that genetically modified circulating tumor cells may serve as targeted vectors to deliver anticancer agents. In a clinical context, this unique paradigm represents a personalized approach to be translated into applications potentially using patient-derived circulating tumor cells as self-targeted vectors for drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the largest component of the autonomic nervous system, with neuron numbers surpassing those present in the spinal cord. The ENS has been called the 'second brain' given its autonomy, remarkable neurotransmitter diversity and complex cytoarchitecture. Defects in ENS development are responsible for many human disorders including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). HSCR is caused by the developmental failure of ENS progenitors to migrate into the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the distal colon. Human ENS development remains poorly understood owing to the lack of an easily accessible model system. Here we demonstrate the efficient derivation and isolation of ENS progenitors from human pluripotent stem (PS) cells, and their further differentiation into functional enteric neurons. ENS precursors derived in vitro are capable of targeted migration in the developing chick embryo and extensive colonization of the adult mouse colon. The in vivo engraftment and migration of human PS-cell-derived ENS precursors rescue disease-related mortality in HSCR mice (Ednrb(s-l/s-l)), although the mechanism of action remains unclear. Finally, EDNRB-null mutant ENS precursors enable modelling of HSCR-related migration defects, and the identification of pepstatin A as a candidate therapeutic target. Our study establishes the first, to our knowledge, human PS-cell-based platform for the study of human ENS development, and presents cell- and drug-based strategies for the treatment of HSCR.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are characterized to have the capacity of self-renewal and the potential to differentiate into mesoderm, ectoderm-like and endoderm-like cells. MSCs hold great promise for cell therapies due to their multipotency in vitro and therapeutic advantage of hypo-immunogenicity and lower tumorigenicity. Moreover, it has been shown that MSCs can serve as a vehicle to transfer mitochondria into cells after cell transplantation. Mitochondria produce most of the energy through oxidative phosphorylation in differentiated cells. It has been increasingly clear that the switch of energy supply from glycolysis to aerobic metabolism is essential for successful differentiation of MSCs. Post-translational modifications of proteins have been established to regulate mitochondrial function and metabolic shift during MSCs differentiation. In this article, we review and provide an integrated view on the roles of different protein kinases and sirtuins in the maintenance and differentiation of MSCs. Importantly, we provide evidence to suggest that alteration in the expression of Sirt3 and Sirt5 and relative changes in the acylation levels of mitochondrial proteins might be involved in the activation of mitochondrial function and adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived MSCs. We summarize their roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism, oxidative responses and differentiation of MSCs. On the other hand, we discuss recent advances in the study of mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial transfer as well as their roles in the differentiation and therapeutic application of MSCs to improve cell function in vitro and in animal models. Accumulating evidence has substantiated that the therapeutic potential of MSCs is conferred not only by cell replacement and paracrine effects but also by transferring mitochondria into injured tissues or cells to modulate the cellular metabolism in situ. Therefore, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism of MSCs may ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes of stem cell therapy in the future.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential anti-fibrotic effect of human Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) combined with praziquantel (PZQ) in S. mansoni-infected mice. S. mansoni-infected mice received early (8(th) week post infection) and late (16(th) week post infection) treatment with WJMSCs, alone and combined with oral PZQ. At the 10(th) month post infection, livers were collected for subsequent flow cytometric, histopathological, morphometric, immunohistochemical, gene expression, and gelatin zymographic studies. After transplantation, WJMSCs differentiated into functioning liver-like cells as evidenced by their ability to express human hepatocyte-specific markers. Regression of S. mansoni-induced liver fibrosis was also observed in transplanted groups, as evidenced by histopathological, morphometric, and gelatin zymographic results besides decreased expression of three essential contributors to liver fibrosis in this particular model; alpha smooth muscle actin, collagen-I, and interleukin-13. PZQ additionally enhanced the beneficial effects observed in WJMSCs-treated groups. Our results suggest that combining WJMSCs to PZQ caused better enhancement in S. mansoni-induced liver fibrosis, compared to using each alone.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of stroke with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) significantly enhances brain remodeling and improves neurological function in non-diabetic stroke rats. Diabetes is a major risk factor for stroke and induces neurovascular changes which may impact stroke therapy. Thus, it is necessary to test our hypothesis that the treatment of stroke with BMSC has therapeutic efficacy in the most common form of diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM was induced in adult male Wistar rats by administration of a high fat diet in combination with a single intraperitoneal injection (35mg/kg) of streptozotocin. These rats were then subjected to 2h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). T2DM rats received BMSC (5x106, n = 8) or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n = 8) via tail-vein injection at 3 days after MCAo. MRI was performed one day and then weekly for 5 weeks post MCAo for all rats. Compared with vehicle treated control T2DM rats, BMSC treatment of stroke in T2DM rats significantly (p<0.05) decreased blood-brain barrier disruption starting at 1 week post stroke measured using contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging with gadopentetate, and reduced cerebral hemorrhagic spots starting at 3 weeks post stroke measured using susceptibility weighted imaging, although BMSC treatment did not reduce the ischemic lesion volumes as demarcated by T2 maps. These MRI measurements were consistent with histological data. Thus, BMSC treatment of stroke in T2DM rats initiated at 3 days after stroke significantly reduced ischemic vascular damage, although BMSC treatment did not change infarction volume in T2DM rats, measured by MRI.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocyte transplantation has potential as a bridge or even alternative to whole-organ liver transplantation. Because donor livers are scarce, realizing this potential requires the development of alternative cell sources. To be therapeutically effective, surrogate hepatocytes must replicate the complex function and ability to proliferate of primary human hepatocytes. Ideally, they are also autologous to eliminate the need for immune suppression, which can have severe side effects and may not be sufficient to prevent rejection long term. In the past decade, several methods have been developed to generate hepatocytes from other readily and safely accessible somatic cells. These lab-made hepatocytes show promise in animal models of liver diseases, supporting the feasibility of autologous liver cell therapies. Here, we review recent preclinical studies exemplifying different types of lab-made hepatocytes that can potentially be used in autologous liver cell therapies. To define the therapeutic efficacy of current lab-made hepatocytes, we compare them to primary human hepatocytes, focusing on engraftment efficiency and posttransplant proliferation and function. In addition to summarizing published results, we discuss animal models and assays effective in assessing therapeutic efficacy. This analysis underscores the therapeutic potential of current lab-made hepatocytes, but also highlights deficiencies and uncertainties that need to be addressed in future studies aimed at developing liver cell therapies with lab-made hepatocytes.

The encouraging results in terms of neovascularization observed in young animals after EPC administration were mitigated in aged patients treated for ischemic CVDs. The limited efficacy of EPC-based therapy in clinical setting might be ascribed at least partly to ageing.

By judging the current public and scientific journal interest, it would seem that CRISPR, by enabling clean, durable knockouts, will dominate therapeutic gene inhibition, also at the expense of RNAi. This review aims to look behind prevailing sentiments and to more clearly define the likely scope of the therapeutic applications of the more recently developed CRISPR technology and its relative strengths and weaknesses with regards to RNAi. It is found that largely because of their broadly overlapping delivery constraints, while CRISPR presents formidable competition for DNA-directed RNAi strategies, its impact on RNAi therapeutics triggered by synthetic oligonucleotides will likely be more moderate. Instead, RNAi and genome editing, and in particular CRISPR, are poised to jointly promote a further shift toward sequence-targeted precision medicines.",

An alternative technique to redirect the immune system toward cancer cells involves the use of T-cells carrying an engineered tumor-recognizing T-cell receptor (TCR). This approach allows targeting of surface or intracellular/nuclear proteins as long as they are processed and presented on the cell surface by human leukocyte antigen molecules. Several trials in advanced solid tumors, particularly melanoma and synovial sarcoma, support the validity of this strategy, although tumor responses have often been short-lived. Emerging data from patients with multiple myeloma and myeloid neoplasms suggest that the benefit of TCR-modified cells may extend to blood cancers. Methodological refinements may be necessary to increase the in vivo persistence and functionality of these cells. Particularly with affinity-enhanced TCRs, however, more effective therapies may increase the potential for serious toxicity due to the unexpected on- or off-target reactivity.",

        "abstract": "In vivo imaging is a platform technology with the power to put function in its natural structural context. With the drive to translate stem cell therapies into pre-clinical and clinical trials, early selection of the right imaging techniques is paramount to success. There are many instances in regenerative medicine where the biological, biochemical, and biomechanical mechanisms behind the proposed function of stem cell therapies can be elucidated by appropriate imaging. Imaging techniques can be divided according to whether labels are used and as to whether the imaging can be done in vivo. In vivo human imaging places additional restrictions on the imaging tools that can be used. Microscopies and nanoscopies, especially those requiring fluorescent markers, have made an extraordinary impact on discovery at the molecular and cellular level, but due to their very limited ability to focus in the scattering tissues encountered for in vivo applications they are largely confined to superficial imaging applications in research laboratories. Nanoscopy, which has tremendous benefits in resolution, is limited to the near-field (e.g. near-field scanning optical microscope (NSNOM)) or to very high light intensity (e.g. stimulated emission depletion (STED)) or to slow stochastic events (photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)). In all cases, nanoscopy is limited to very superficial applications. Imaging depth may be increased using multiphoton or coherence gating tricks. Scattering dominates the limitation on imaging depth in most tissues and this can be mitigated by the application of optical clearing techniques that can impose mild (e.g. topical application of glycerol) or severe (e.g. CLARITY) changes to the tissue to be imaged. Progression of therapies through to clinical trials requires some thought as to the imaging and sensing modalities that should be used. Smoother progression is facilitated by the use of comparable imaging modalities throughout the discovery and trial phases, giving label-free techniques an advantage wherever they can be used, although this is seldom considered in the early stages. In this paper, we will explore the techniques that have found success in aiding discovery in stem cell therapies and try to predict the likely technologies best suited to translation and future directions.",

        "abstract": "Lower back pain from degenerative disc disease represents a global health burden, and presents a prominent opportunity for regenerative therapeutics. While current regenerative therapies such as autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT), allogeneic juvenile chondrocyte implantation (NuQu\u5e90), and immunoselected allogeneic adipose derived precursor cells (Mesoblast) show exciting clinical potential, limitations remain. The heterogeneity of preclinical approaches and the paucity of clinical guidance have limited translational outcomes in disc repair, lagging almost a decade behind cartilage repair. Advances in cartilage repair have evolved to single step approaches with improved orthopedic repair and regeneration. Elements from cartilage regeneration endeavors could be adopted and applied to harness translatable approaches and deliver a clinically and economically feasible regenerative surgery for back pain. In this article, we trace the developments behind the translational success of cartilage repair, examine elements to consider in achieving disc regeneration, and the need for surgical redesign. We further discuss clinical parameters, objectives, and coordination required to deliver improved regenerative surgery. Cell source, processing, and delivery modalities are key issues to be addressed in considering surgical redesign. Advances in biomanufacturing, tissue cryobanking, and point of care cell processing technology may enable intraoperative solutions for single step procedures. To maximize translational success a triad partnership between clinicians, industry, and researchers will be critical in providing instructive clinical guidelines for design as well as practical and economic considerations. This will allow a consensus in research ventures and add regenerative surgery into the algorithm in managing and treating a debilitating condition such as back pain. \u6f0f 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

        "abstract": "Retinal vascular conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, remain leading causes of vision loss. No therapy exists to restore vision loss resulting from retinal ischemia and associated retinal degeneration. Tissue regeneration is possible with cell therapy. The goal would be to restore or replace the damaged retinal vasculature and the retinal neurons that are damaged and/or degenerating from the hypoxic insult. Currently, various adult cell therapies have been explored as potential treatment. They include mesenchymal stem cells, vascular precursor cells (i.e., CD34+ cells, hematopoietic cells or endothelial progenitor cells), and adipose stromal cells. Preclinical studies show that all these cells have a paracrine trophic effect on damaged ischemic tissue, leading to tissue preservation. Endothelial progenitor cells and adipose stromal cells integrate into the damaged retinal vascular wall in preclinical models of diabetic retinopathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mesenchymal stem cells do not integrate as readily but appear to have a primary paracrine trophic effect. Early phase clinical trials have been initiated and ongoing using mesenchymal stem cells or autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells injected intravitreally as potential therapy for diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. Adipose stromal cells or pluripotent stem cells differentiated into endothelial colony-forming cells have been explored in preclinical studies and show promise as possible therapies for retinal vascular disorders. The relative safety or efficacy of these various cell therapies for treating retinal vascular disorders have yet to be determined.",

        "abstract": "Preterm neonates are susceptible to perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, for which no treatment is available. In a preclinical animal model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in ovine fetuses, we have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of systemically administered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The mechanism of MSC treatment is unclear but suggested to be paracrine, through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Therefore, we investigated in this study the protective effects of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) in a preclinical model of preterm hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Ovine fetuses were subjected to global hypoxia-ischemia by transient umbilical cord occlusion, followed by in utero intravenous administration of MSC-EVs. The therapeutic effects of MSC-EV administration were assessed by analysis of electrophysiological parameters and histology of the brain. Systemic administration of MSC-EVs improved brain function by reducing the total number and duration of seizures, and by preserving baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. These functional protections were accompanied by a tendency to prevent hypomyelination. Cerebral inflammation remained unaffected by the MSC-EV treatment. Our data demonstrate that MSC-EV treatment might provide a novel strategy to reduce the neurological sequelae following hypoxic-ischemic injury of the preterm brain. Our study results suggest that a cell-free preparation comprising neuroprotective MSC-EVs could substitute MSCs in the treatment of preterm neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, thereby circumventing the potential risks of systemic administration of living cells.",

        "abstract": "Lymphatic metastasis is a poor prognostic factor in ovarian cancer, which correlates to the majority of cancer deaths. Matrix protein (MP) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exhibits potent antitumor and antiangiogenic activities through inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. In this study, the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of MP were further investigated. Wild-type SKOV3 (WT-SK) cells were successfully transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1 plasmid, or pcDNA3.1-VEGF-D recombinant plasmid to construct cell lines named EV-SK, and VEGFD-SK, respectively. Inhibition of VEGFD-SK cell migration and invasion was detected by Transwell and wound healing assay. Then, lymphogenous metastatic model of ovarian cancer was established by injecting VEGFD-SK cells subcutaneously into the left hindlimb claw pad of nude mice. The inducted apoptotic effect of MP on VEGFD-SK cells were assessed by flow analysis and Hoechst-33258 staining, respectively, in\u807dvitro. The in\u807dvivo antitumor and antiangiogenic activities of MP gene were evaluated with lymphogenous metastatic model of ovarian cancer. Tumor volume and lymphatic metastasis rates were measured. Lymphatic vessels were delineated using Evan's blue and LYVE-1 staining. Expression of VEGF-D and MMP-2 were evaluated by immunostaining. Apoptosis of tumor cells was analyzed by Hoechst-33258 staining. Mice bearing VEGFD-SK tumor cells displayed more rapid tumorigenesis, higher lymphogenous metastatic tendency and increased lymphatic vessel density compared with the mice bearing WT-SK or EV-SK cells. However, VEGF-D-enhanced metastasis was evidently reversed by MP. MP significantly reduced the invasion of VEGFD-SK cells, tumor volume, lymphatic metastasis rates and lymphatic vessel density compared with control groups (P<0.05), accompanied with down-expression of VEGF-D and MMP-2 and increased apoptosis. Our data indicate that MP has strong antitumor and antimetastatic abilities, and it may be a promising therapeutic strategy against the lymphatic metastasis of human ovarian cancer.",

BiTEs were secreted from the transferred T cells and enabled both the transferred and bystander T cells to specifically recognize CD19(+) cell lines, with increased tumor killing ability, prolonged functional persistence, increased cytokine production and potent proliferation compared with the CAR-T cells. More interestingly, in comparison with CD3/CD28 bead-stimulated T cells, T cells that were expanded by a rapid T-cell expansion protocol (REP) showed enhanced anti-tumor activities for both CAR and BiTE RNA-electroporated T cells both in vitro and in a Nalm6 mouse model (P<0.01). Furthermore, the REP T cells with BiTE RNAs showed greater efficacy in the Nalm6 leukemia model compared with REP T cells with CAR RNA (P<0.05) and resulted in complete leukemia remission.",

        "abstract": "We have recently described sustained clinical recovery associated with dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination following transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a viral model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. The hNPCs used in that study were derived by a novel direct differentiation method (direct differentiation, DD-NPCs) that resulted in a unique gene expression pattern when compared to hNPCs derived by conventional methods. Since the therapeutic potential of human NPCs may differ greatly depending on the method of derivation and culture, we wanted to determine whether NPCs differentiated using conventional methods would be similarly effective in improving clinical outcome under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. For the current study, we utilized hNPCs differentiated from a human induced pluripotent cell line via an embryoid body intermediate stage (EB-NPCs). Intraspinal transplantation of EB-NPCs into mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system that was concomitant with reduced demyelination at the site of injection. Dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination was correlated with a transient increase in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) concentrated within the peripheral lymphatics. However, compared to our earlier study, pathological improvements were modest and did not result in significant clinical recovery. We conclude that the genetic signature of NPCs is critical to their effectiveness in this model of viral-induced neurologic disease. These comparisons will be useful for understanding what factors are critical for the sustained clinical improvement.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell transplantation showed promising results in IBD management. However, the therapeutic impacts of cell delivery route that is critical for clinical translation are currently poorly understood. Here, three different MSCs delivery routes: intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV), and anal injection (AI) were compared on DSS-induced colitic mice model. The overall therapeutic factors, MSCs migration and targeting as well as local immunomodulatory cytokines and FoxP3(+) cells infiltration were analyzed. Colitis showed varying degrees of alleviation after three ways of MSCs transplantation, and the IP injection showed the highest survival rate of 87.5% and displayed the less weight loss and quick weight gain. The fecal occult blood test on the day 3 also showed nearly complete absence of occult blood in IP group. The fluorescence imaging disclosed higher intensity of engrafted cells in inflamed colon and the corresponding mesentery lymph nodes (MLNs) in IP and AI groups than the IV group. Real time-PCR and ELISA also demonstrate lower TNF-\u4f2a and higher IL-10, TSG-6 levels in IP group. The immunohistochemistry indicated higher repair proliferation (Ki-67) and more FoxP3(+) cells accumulation of IP group. IP showed better colitis recovery and might be the optimum MSCs delivery route for the treatment of DSS-induced colitis.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell therapy has revolutionized modern clinical therapy with the potential of stem cells to differentiate into many different cell types which may help to replace different cell lines of an organism. Innumerous trials are carried out to merge new scientific knowledge and techniques with traditional herbal extracts that may result in less toxic, affordable, and highly available natural alternative therapeutics. Currently, mesenchyamal stromal cell (MSC) lines are treated with individual and mixtures of crude herbal extracts, as well as with purified compounds from herbal extracts, to investigate the mechanisms and effects of these on stem cell growth and differentiation. Human MSCs (hMSCs) possess multilineage, i.e., osteogenic, neurogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic, differentiation abilities. The proliferative and differentiation properties of hMSCs treated with herbal extracts have shown promise in diseases such as osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and other tissue degenerative disorders. Well characterized herbal extracts that result in increased rates of tissue regeneration may be used in both stem cell therapy and tissue engineering for replacement therapy, where the use of scaffolds and vesicles with enhanced attaching and proliferative properties could be highly advantageous in the latter. Although the clinical application of herbal extracts is still in progress due to the variability and complexity of bioactive constituents, standardized herbal preparations will strengthen their application in the clinical context. We have critically reviewed the proliferative and differentiation effects of individual herbal extracts on hMSCs mainly derived from bone marrow and elaborated on the plausible underlying mechanisms of action. To be fruitfully used in reparative and regenerative therapy, future directions in this area of study should (i) make use of hMSCs derived from different non-traditional sources, including medical waste material (umbilical cord, Wharton's jelly, and placenta), (ii) take account of the vast numbers of herbal extracts used in traditional medicine globally, and (iii) investigate the mechanisms and pathways of their effects on hMSCs.",

Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) enable the label-free, scalable, and cost-effective separation of cells, making them a promising tool for downstream processing of cell-based therapeutics. Here, we report the development of an automated robotic screening that enables high-throughput cell partitioning analysis in ATPS. We demonstrate that this setup enables fast and systematic investigation of factors influencing cell partitioning. Moreover, we examined and optimized separation conditions for the differentiable promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and used a counter-current distribution-model to investigate optimal separation conditions for a multi-stage purification process. Finally, we show that the separation of CD11b-positive and CD11b-negative HL-60 cells is possible after partial DMSO-mediated differentiation towards the granulocytic lineage. The modeling data indicate that complete peak separation is possible with 30 transfers, and >93% of CD11b-positive HL-60 cells can be recovered with >99% purity. The here described screening platform facilitates faster, cheaper, and more directed downstream process development for cell-based therapeutics and presents a powerful tool for translational research.",

Understanding the alterations in the cell populations induced by the virus is pivotal and can help to combat HIV at the time of infection and above all, to prevent the establishment of viral reservoirs.

These challenges include pinpointing the optimal graft location, appropriately scaling up the graft volume, and minimizing the risk of chronic immune rejection, among others. To advance this procedure to the clinic, it is imperative that a model that accurately and fully recapitulates characteristics most pertinent to a cell-based transplantation to the human brain is used to optimize key technical aspects of the procedure. Nonhuman primates mimic humans in multiple ways including similarities in genomics, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, immunogenetics, and age-related changes in immune function. These characteristics are critical to the establishment of a relevant model in which to conduct preclinical studies to optimize the efficacy and safety of cell-based therapeutic approaches to the treatment of PD. Here we review previous studies in rodent models, and emphasize additional advantages afforded by nonhuman primate models in general, and the baboon model in particular, for preclinical optimization of cell-based therapeutic approaches to the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. We outline current unresolved challenges to the successful application of stem cell therapies in humans and propose that the baboon model in particular affords a number of traits that render it most useful for preclinical studies designed to overcome these challenges.",

        "abstract": "The chemokine SDF-1\u4f2a plays a critical role in mediating stem cell response to injury and disease and has specifically been shown to mobilize neural progenitor/stem cells (NPSCs) towards sites of neural injury. Current neural transplant paradigms within the brain suffer from low rates of retention and engraftment after injury. Therefore, increasing transplant sensitivity to injury-induced SDF-1\u4f2a represents a method for increasing neural transplant efficacy. Previously, we have reported on a hyaluronic acid-laminin based hydrogel (HA-Lm gel) that increases NPSC expression of SDF-1\u4f2a receptor, CXCR4, and subsequently, NPSC chemotactic migration towards a source of SDF-1\u4f2a in vitro. The study presented here investigates the capacity of the HA-Lm gel to promote NPSC response to exogenous SDF-1\u4f2a in vivo. We observed the HA-Lm gel to significantly increase NPSC transplant retention and migration in response to SDF-1\u4f2a in a manner critically dependent on signaling via the SDF-1\u4f2a-CXCR4 axis. This work lays the foundation for development of a more effective cell therapy for neural injury, but also has broader implications in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine given the essential roles of SDF-1\u4f2a across injury and disease states.",

        "abstract": "Manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) from progenitors has been proposed as a method to reduce reliance on donors. Such a process would need to be extremely efficient for economic viability given a relatively low value product and high (2\u807d\u8133\u807d10 ) cell dose. Therefore, the aim of these studies was to define the productivity of an industry standard stirred-tank bioreactor and determine engineering limitations of commercial red blood cells production. Cord blood derived CD34+ cells were cultured under erythroid differentiation conditions in a stirred micro-bioreactor (Ambr\u9229?. Enucleated cells of 80% purity could be created under optimal physical conditions: pH\u807d7.5, 50% oxygen, without gas-sparging (which damaged cells) and with mechanical agitation (which directly increased enucleation). O consumption was low (~5\u807d\u8133\u807d10 \u807d\u6e2dg/cell.h) theoretically enabling erythroblast densities in excess of 5\u807d\u8133\u807d10 /ml in commercial bioreactors and sub-10\u807dl/unit production volumes. The bioreactor process achieved a 24% and 42% reduction in media volume and culture time, respectively, relative to unoptimized flask processing. However, media exchange limited productivity to 1 unit of erythroblasts per 500\u807dl of media. Systematic replacement of media constituents, as well as screening for inhibitory levels of ammonia, lactate and key cytokines did not identify a reason for this limitation. We conclude that the properties of erythroblasts are such that the conventional constraints on cell manufacturing efficiency, such as mass transfer and metabolic demand, should not prevent high intensity production; furthermore, this could be achieved in industry standard equipment. However, identification and removal of an inhibitory mediator is required to enable these economies to be realized.

However, there are some disadvantages with this treatment modality including compliance challenges to patients. Therefore, a physiologically based alternative therapy for hypothyroidism with little or no side-effects is needed. In this study, we have developed a method for microencapsulating porcine thyroid cells as a thyroid hormone replacement approach. The hybrid wall of the polymer microcapsules permits thyroid hormone release while preventing immunoglobulin antibodies from entry. This strategy could potentially enable implantation of the microcapsule organoids containing allogeneic or xenogeneic thyroid cells to secret hormones over time without the need for immunosuppression of recipients. Porcine thyroid cells were isolated and encapsulated in alginate-poly-L-ornithine-alginate microcapsules using a microfluidic device. The porcine thyroid cells formed three-dimensional follicular spheres in the microcapsules with decent cell viability and proliferation. Thyroxine release from the encapsulated cells was higher than from unencapsulated cells ( P\u9225?\u9225?.05) and was maintained during the entire duration of experiment (>28 days). These results suggest that the microencapsulated thyroid cell organoids may have the potential to be used for therapy and/or drug screening.",

        "abstract": "Recent trials of adoptive cell therapy (ACT), such as the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for cancer patients. A main issue in the product development is to determine the appropriate dose of ACT. Traditional phase I trial designs for cytotoxic agents explicitly assume that toxicity increases monotonically with dose levels and implicitly assume the same for efficacy to justify dose escalation. ACT usually induces rapid responses, and the monotonic dose-response assumption is unlikely to hold due to its immunobiologic activities. We propose a toxicity and efficacy probability interval (TEPI) design for dose finding in ACT trials. This approach incorporates efficacy outcomes to inform dosing decisions to optimize efficacy and safety simultaneously. Rather than finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the TEPI design is aimed at finding the dose with the most desirable outcome for safety and efficacy. The key features of TEPI are its simplicity, flexibility, and transparency, because all decision rules can be prespecified prior to trial initiation. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the TEPI design and compare it to existing methods. In summary, the TEPI design is a novel method for ACT dose finding, which possesses superior performance and is easy to use, simple, and transparent. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 13-20. \u6f0f2016 AACR.",

Cells were cultivated in MSC culture medium. Properties of MSCs were confirmed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR analysis, immunocytochemistry assays, and multilineage differentiation. Hepatic induction was performed using a three-step differentiation protocol with various growth factors.

However, hematopoietic- and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)-related surface markers (CD133, CD34, CD45, and E-cadherin) had a higher expression in hLF-ADSCs. The hepatic induction marker genes had a higher expression in hLF-ADSCs on days 7 and 10 after the hepatic induction. Albumin secretion was similar between hLF-ADSCs and hAS-ADSCs at 20 days after the hepatic induction. The hLF-ADSCs had a different pattern of surface marker expression relative to hAS-ADSCs.

However, the experimental and preclinical applications of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs) in the very field of maxillofacial bone tissue engineering are still limited. In this study, rat AFSCs were successfully harvested and characterized in vitro. The rat AFSCs showed typical fibroblastoid morphology, stable proliferation activity and multi-differentiation potential. Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that these cells were positive for CD29, CD44, and CD90, while negative for hematopoietic markers such as CD34 and CD45. The regenerative performance of AFSCs-premixed with platelet rich plasma (PRP) gel in restoration of alveolar bone defect was further investigated using a modified rat maxillary alveolar defect model. Micro-computer tomography and histological examination showed a superior regenerative capacity of AFSCs-premixed with PRP gel at both 4 and 8 weeks after operation comparing with control groups. Moreover, the implanted AFSCs can survive in the defect site and directly participate in the bone tissue regeneration. Taken together, these results indicated the feasibility of an AFSCs-based alveolar bone tissue engineering strategy for alveolar defect restoration.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have emerged as promising cell therapies for multiple conditions based on demonstrations of their potent immunomodulatory and regenerative capacities in models of inflammatory disease. Understanding the effects of MSC on T cells has dominated the majority of work carried out in this field to date; recently, however, a number of studies have shown that the therapeutic effect of MSC requires the presence of macrophages. It is timely to review the mechanisms and manner by which MSC modulate macrophage populations in order to design more effective MSC therapies and clinical studies. A complex cross-talk exists through which MSC and macrophages communicate, a communication that is not controlled exclusively by MSC. Here, we examine the evidence that suggests that MSC not only respond to inflammatory macrophages and adjust their secretome accordingly, but also that macrophages respond to encounters with MSC, creating a feedback loop which contributes to the immune regulation observed following MSC therapy. Future studies examining the effects of MSC on macrophages should consider the antagonistic role that macrophages play in this exchange.",

Expert opinion: Adjunct therapies which improve host endothelial function have demonstrated promising outcomes, potentially overcoming disappointing results of cell therapy in human studies. In the future, elucidation of the interactions between the host tissue and therapeutic agents, as well as downstream signaling pathways, will be the next challenges in enhancing regenerative therapy. More careful investigations are also required to establish these agents' safety and efficacy for wide usage in humans.",

        "abstract": "Older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have a poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapies are needed. Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells have been adoptively transferred with promising clinical results. Here, we report the first-in-human study exploiting a unique scalable NK-cell product generated from CD34 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from partially HLA-matched umbilical cord blood units. Ten older AML patients in morphologic complete remission received an escalating HSPC-NK cell dose (between 3 and 30 \u8133 10/kg body weight) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy without cytokine boosting. HSPC-NK cell products contained a median of 75% highly activated NK cells, with <1 \u8133 10 T cells/kg and <3 \u8133 10 B cells/kg body weight. HSPC-NK cells were well tolerated, and neither graft-versus-host disease nor toxicity was observed. Despite no cytokine boosting being given, transient HSPC-NK cell persistence was clearly found in peripheral blood up to 21% until day 8, which was accompanied by augmented IL15 plasma levels. Moreover, donor chimerism up to 3.5% was found in bone marrow. Interestingly, HSPC-NK cell maturation was observed, indicated by the rapid acquisition of CD16 and KIR expression, while expression of most activating receptors was sustained. Notably, 2 of 4 patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow before infusion became MRD negative (<0.1%), which lasted for 6 months. These findings indicate that HSPC-NK cell adoptive transfer is a promising, potential \"off-the-shelf\" translational immunotherapy approach in AML. .",

Pathological conditions including ischemia activate Hh signaling in adult tissues.

        "abstract": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a noninvasive widely applied treatment that increases the oxygen pressure in tissues. In cochlear implant (CI) research, intracochlear application of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) is able to improve survival of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) after deafness. Cell-based delivery of NTFs such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be realized by cell-coating of the surface of the CI electrode. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) secrete a variety of different neurotrophic factors and may be used for the development of a biohybrid electrode in order to release endogenously-derived neuroprotective factors for the protection of residual SGN and for a guided outgrowth of dendrites in the direction of the CI electrode. HBOT could be used to influence cell behaviour after transplantation to the inner ear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HBOT on the proliferation, BDNF-release and secretion of neuroprotective factors. Thus, model cells (an immortalized fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3)-native and genetically modified) and MSCs were repeatedly (3 x - 10 x) exposed to 100% oxygen at different pressures. The effects of HBO on cell proliferation were investigated in relation to normoxic and normobaric conditions (NOR). Moreover, the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of HBO-treated cells were analysed by cultivation of SGN in conditioned medium. Both, the genetically modified NIH3T3/BDNF and native NIH3T3 fibroblasts, showed a highly significant increased proliferation after five days of HBOT in comparison to normoxic controls. By contrast, the number of MSCs was decreased in MSCs treated with 2.0 bar of HBO. Treating SGN cultures with supernatants of fibroblasts and MSCs significantly increased the survival rate of SGN. HBO treatment did not influence (increase / reduce) this effect. Secretome analysis showed that HBO treatment altered the protein expression pattern in MSCs.",

However, the in\u9225\u537eitro preservation of labile lymphocytes during transfer, manipulation, and storage has been one of the bottlenecks in the development and commercialization of therapeutic lymphocytes. Herein, we suggest a cell-in-shell (or artificial spore) strategy to enhance the cell viability in the practical settings, while maintaining biological activities for therapeutic efficacy. A durable titanium oxide (TiO ) shell is formed on individual Jurkat T cells, and the CD3 and other antigens on cell surfaces remain accessible to the antibodies. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion is also not hampered by the shell formation. This work suggests a chemical toolbox for effectively preserving lymphocytes in\u9225\u537eitro and developing the lymphocyte-based cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Many neurological disorders stem from defects in or the loss of specific neurons. Neuron transplantation has tremendous clinical potential for central nervous system therapy as it may allow for the targeted replacement of those cells that are lost in diseases. Normally, most neurons are added during restricted periods of embryonic and fetal development. The permissive milieu of the developing brain promotes neuronal migration, neuronal differentiation, and synaptogenesis. Once this active period of neurogenesis ends, the chemical and physical environment of the brain changes dramatically. The brain parenchyma becomes highly packed with neuronal and glial processes, extracellular matrix, myelin, and synapses. The migration of grafted cells to allow them to home into target regions and become functionally integrated is a key challenge to neuronal transplantation. Interestingly, transplanted young telencephalic inhibitory interneurons are able to migrate, differentiate, and integrate widely throughout the postnatal brain. These grafted interneurons can also functionally modify local circuit activity. These features have facilitated the use of interneuron transplantation to study fundamental neurodevelopmental processes including cell migration, cell specification, and programmed neuronal cell death. Additionally, these cells provide a unique opportunity to develop interneuron-based strategies for the treatment of diseases linked to interneuron dysfunction and neurological disorders associated to circuit hyperexcitability.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based therapy using umbilical cord blood (UCB) is being used increasingly in novel applications. To balance heightened public expectations and ensure appropriateness of emerging cell-based treatment choices, regular evidence-based assessment of novel UCB-derived therapies is needed. We performed a systematic search of the literature and identified 57 studies (814 patients) for analysis. Sixteen of these studies (353 patients) included a control group for comparison. The most commonly reported novel indication for therapy was neurologic diseases (25 studies, 476 patients), including studies of cerebral palsy (12 studies, 276 patients). Other indications included diabetes mellitus (9 studies, 149 patients), cardiac and vascular diseases (7 studies, 24 patients), and hepatic diseases (4 studies, 106 patients). Most studies administered total nucleated cells, mononuclear cells, or CD34-selected cells (31 studies, 513 patients), whereas 20 studies described the use of UCB-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. The majority of reports (46 studies, 627 patients) described cellular products obtained from allogeneic sources, whereas 11 studies (187 patients) used autologous products. We identified 3 indications where multiple prospective controlled studies have been published: 4 of 4 studies reported clinical benefit in cerebral palsy, 1 of 3 studies reported benefit for cirrhosis, and 1 of 3 studies reported biochemical response in type 1 diabetes), although heterogeneity among the studies precluded meaningful pooled analysis of results. We anticipate a more clear understanding of the clinical benefit for specific indications once more controlled studies are reported. Patients should continue to be enrolled on registered clinical trials for novel therapies. Blood establishments, transplantation centers, and regulatory bodies need to prepare for greater clinical demand.",

Here we show that bioconstructs suffused with genetically-labelled muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and other muscle resident cells (MRCs) are effective to treat VML injuries in mice. Imaging of bioconstructs implanted in damaged muscles indicates MuSCs survival and growth, and ex vivo analyses show force restoration of treated muscles. Histological analysis highlights myofibre formation, neovascularisation, but insufficient innervation. Both innervation and in vivo force production are enhanced when implantation of bioconstructs is followed by an exercise regimen. Significant improvements are also observed when bioconstructs are used to treat chronic VML injury models. Finally, we demonstrate that bioconstructs made with human MuSCs and MRCs can generate functional muscle tissue in our VML model. These data suggest that stem cell-based therapies aimed to engineer tissue in vivo may be effective to treat acute and chronic VML.",

        "abstract": "Ex vivo-expanded stem cells have long been a cornerstone of biotherapeutics and have attracted increasing attention for treating intractable diseases and improving tissue regeneration. However, using exogenous cellular materials to develop restorative treatments for large numbers of patients has become a major concern for both economic and safety reasons. Advances in cell biological research over the past two decades have expanded the potential for using endogenous stem cells during wound healing processes, and in particular, recent insight into stem cell movement and homing has prompted regenerative research and therapy based on recruiting endogenous cells. Inspired by the natural healing process, artificial administration of specific chemokines as signals systemically or at the injury site, typically using biomaterials as vehicles, is a state-of-the-art strategy that potentiates stem cell homing and recreates an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory microenvironment to enhance in situ tissue regeneration. However, pharmacologically coaxing endogenous stem cells to act as therapeutics in the field of biomedicine remains in the early stages; its efficacy is limited by the lack of innovative methodologies for chemokine presentation and release. This review describes how to direct the homing of endogenous stem cells via the administration of specific signals, with a particular emphasis on targeted signalling molecules that regulate this homing process, to enhance in situ tissue regeneration. We also provide an outlook on and critical considerations for future investigations to enhance stem cell recruitment and harness the reparative potential of these recruited cells as a clinically relevant cell therapy.",

Nanocarriers encapsulating biologically active cargo or extreme intraluminal pH were injected directly into the cytosol of cells, where they bypassed subcellular processing pathways and remained intact for several days. Nanocarriers' size was found to dictate their intracellular distribution pattern upon injection, with larger vesicles adopting polarized agglomerated distributions and smaller colloids spreading evenly in the cytosol. This in turn determined the symmetry or asymmetry of their dilution following cell division, ultimately affecting the intracellular dose at a cell population level. As an example of microinjection's applicability, a cell type relevant for cell-based therapies (dendritic cells) was injected with vesicles, and its migratory properties were studied in a co-culture system mimicking lymphatic capillaries.",

Identification of genetic mutations and pathophysiological changes that underlie disease development can inform clinical practice and guide novel drug development. However, disease mechanisms in a large number of patients remain elusive and pharmacologic treatment is suboptimal, so many patients rely on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cell models of disease facilitate analysis of disease mechanisms in patient-specific cardiomyocytes, overcoming limitations of animal models and human tissue restrictions. This review outlines how studies using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin disease pathogenesis and their potential to facilitate new pharmacologic therapies and personalized medicine.",

By using non-obese diabetic (NOD) BDC2.5 TCR-transgenic (Tg), and IL-10 and Foxp3 double-reporter mice, we demonstrate that alteration of gut microbiota during cohousing experiments or treatment with anti-CD3 mAb significantly increase intestinal IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells and decrease diabetes incidence. These intestinal antigen-specific Tr1 cells have the ability to migrate to the periphery via a variety of chemokine receptors such as CCR4, CCR5, and CCR7 and to suppress proliferation of Th1 cells in the pancreas. The ability of Tr1 cells to cure diabetes in NOD mice required IL-10 signaling, as Tr1 cells could not suppress CD4 T cells with a dominant-negative IL-10R. Taken together, our data show a key role of intestinal Tr1 cells in the control of effector T cells and development of diabetes. Therefore, modulating gut-associated lymphoid tissue to boost Tr1 cells may be important in type 1 diabetes management.",

        "abstract": "Retinal dystrophies (RDs) are the most common cause of inherited blindness and one of the most genetically heterogeneous human diseases. RDs arise from mutations in genes involved in development and function of photoreceptors or other retinal cells. Identification of the genetic defect causing RD allows accurate diagnosis, prognosis,\u807dand counseling in affected patients. Molecular diagnosis is a tremendous challenge in RDs due to their locus and phenotypic heterogeneity. As conventional DNA sequencing approaches are impractical in such situation, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based protocols are needed to identify RD-causing mutations. This is being accomplished by sequencing RD gene panels or by whole exome or whole genome sequencing approaches. Areas covered: This review discusses the current strategies for molecular diagnosis in RDs including their advantages and limitations, as well as their utility in diagnosis of non-syndromic versus syndromic RDs. Results of ongoing gene therapy protocols in RDs are also presented. Expert commentary: Molecular diagnosis in RD improves the medical management of patients. Importantly, demand for molecular screening for RDs is greatly expanding not only as a result of increasing development and availability of NGS technologies, but also of the growing number of gene-based clinical trials offering a potential treatment to patients.",

        "abstract": "As the HIV pandemic rapidly spread worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s, a new approach to treat cancer, genetic diseases, and infectious diseases was also emerging. Cell and gene therapy strategies are connected with human pathologies at a fundamental level, by delivering DNA and RNA molecules that could correct and/or ameliorate the underlying genetic factors of any illness. The history of HIV gene therapy is especially intriguing, in that the virus that was targeted was soon co-opted to become part of the targeting strategy. Today, HIV-based lentiviral vectors, along with many other gene delivery strategies, have been used to evaluate HIV cure approaches in cell culture, small and large animal models, and in patients. Here, we trace HIV cell and gene therapy from the earliest clinical trials, using genetically unmodified cell products from the patient or from matched donors, through current state-of-the-art strategies. These include engineering HIV-specific immunity in T-cells, gene editing approaches to render all blood cells in the body HIV-resistant, and most importantly, combination therapies that draw from both of these respective \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" approaches. It is widely agreed upon that combinatorial approaches are the most promising route to functional cure/remission of HIV infection. This chapter outlines cell and gene therapy strategies that are poised to play an essential role in eradicating HIV-infected cells in vivo.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been explored as promising cell therapy in MI and regenerative therapy. Recently, reports investigated the potential therapeutic effects of MSCs or HSCs transplantation after MI in numerous experimental and clinical studies; however, their results are controversy and needs more explorations. The current review is an attempt to clarify the therapeutic potentials of MSCs and HSCs in MI therapy, as well as their possible effects; especially the paracrine one and the exosome-derived stem cell among animal models as well as clinical trials conducted within the last 10 years. In this context, various sources of MSCs and HSCs have been addressed in helping cardiac regeneration by either revitalizing the cardiac stem cells niche or revascularizing the arteries and veins of the heart. In addition, both MSCs and HSCs could produce paracrine mediators and growth factors which led to cardiomyocytes protection, angiogenesis, immunemodulation, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, as well as increasing cardiac contractility. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), a miRNA sponge, are recent stem cell-derived mediators can be promising targets of MSCs and HSCs through their paracrine effects. Although MSCs and HSCs have achieved considerable achievements, however, some challenges still remain that need to be overcome in order to establish it as a successful technique.

        "abstract": "Cell encapsulation has been shown to hold promise for effective, long-term treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, challenges remain for its clinical applications. For example, there is an unmet need for an encapsulation system that is capable of delivering sufficient cell mass while still allowing convenient retrieval or replacement. Here, we report a simple cell encapsulation design that is readily scalable and conveniently retrievable. The key to this design was to engineer a highly wettable, Ca-releasing nanoporous polymer thread that promoted uniform in situ cross-linking and strong adhesion of a thin layer of alginate hydrogel around the thread. The device provided immunoprotection of rat islets in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice in a short-term (1-mo) study, similar to neat alginate fibers. However, the mechanical property of the device, critical for handling and retrieval, was much more robust than the neat alginate fibers due to the reinforcement of the central thread. It also had facile mass transfer due to the short diffusion distance. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the device through the correction of chemically induced diabetes in C57BL/6 mice using rat islets for 3 mo as well as in immunodeficient SCID-Beige mice using human islets for 4 mo. We further showed, as a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability in dogs. After 1 mo of implantation in dogs, the device could be rapidly retrieved through a minimally invasive laparoscopic procedure. This encapsulation device may contribute to a cellular therapy for T1D because of its retrievability and scale-up potential.",

However, manufacturing bottlenecks related to the enrichment of therapeutically optimal T-cell subpopulations from leukopak samples impede scale-up and scale-out efforts. This is mainly attributed to the challenges that current cell purification platforms face in balancing the quantitative sorting capacity needed to isolate specific T-cell subsets with the scalability to meet manufacturing throughputs. In this work, we report a continuous-flow, quantitative cell enrichment platform based on a technique known as ratcheting cytometry that can perform complex, multicomponent purification targeting various subpopulations of magnetically labeled T cells directly from apheresis or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. The integrated ratcheting cytometry instrument and cartridge demonstrated enrichment of T cells directly from concentrated apheresis samples with a 97% purity and an 85% recovery of magnetically tagged cells. Magnetic sorting of different T-cell subpopulations was also accomplished on chip by multiplexing cell surface targets onto particles with differing magnetic strengths. We believe that ratcheting cytometry's quantitative capacity and throughput scalability represents an excellent technology candidate to alleviate cell therapy manufacturing bottlenecks.",

        "abstract": "Autologous fat grafting after breast cancer surgery is commonly performed, but concerns about oncologic risk remain. To model the interaction between fat grafting and breast cancer cells, two approaches were employed. In the first approach, graded numbers of viable MDA-MB-231 or BT-474 cells were admixed directly into human fat grafts and injected subcutaneously into immune-deficient mice to determine if the healing graft is a supportive environment for the tumor. In the second approach, graded doses of MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in Matrigel and injected into the mammary fat pads of mice. Two weeks after the tumor cells engrafted, 100 \u6e2dL of human adipose tissue was grafted into the same site. Histologically, MDA-MB-231 cells seeded within fat grafts were observed and stained positive for human-specific pan-cytokeratin and Ki67. The BT-474 cells failed to survive when seeded within fat grafts at any dose. In the second approach, MDA-MB-231 cells had a strong trend toward lower Ki67 staining at all doses. Regression analysis on all groups with fat grafts and MDA-MB-231 revealed fat tissue was associated with lower cancer cell Ki67 staining. Healing fat grafts do not support the epithelial BT-474 cell growth, and support the mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cell growth only at doses ten times greater than in Matrigel controls. Moreover, fat grafts in association with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells already present in the wound resulted in decreased tumor proliferation and increased fibrosis. These findings suggest that clinical fat grafting does not induce breast cancer cell growth, and may even have a suppressive effect. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:125-134.",

In this study, skin-derived precursors pre-differentiated into Schwann cells (SKP-SCs) were used as parent cells to generate acellular(ACM) for constructing a ACM-modified neural scaffold. SKP-SCs were co-cultured with chitosan nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and silk fibroin filamentous fillers, followed by decellularization to stimulate ACM deposition. This NGC-based, SKP-SC-derived ACM-modified neural scaffold was used for bridging a 10\u9225\u75ecm long rat sciatic nerve gap. Histological and functional evaluation after grafting demonstrated that regenerative outcomes achieved by this engineered neural scaffold were better than those achieved by a plain chitosan-silk fibroin scaffold, and suggested the benefits of SKP-SC-derived ACM for peripheral nerve repair.",

However, it is unclear whether morphological differences correlate with functionality, and this lack of knowledge limits their translational applications. Here, we show that SS-hAFSCs and RS-hAFSCs differ in their neuro-protective ability, demonstrating that a single contralateral injection of SS-hAFSCs into hypoxic-ischemic P7 mice conferred a 47% reduction in hippocampal tissue loss and 43-45% reduction in TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus and striatum 48\u9225\u5870ours after the insult, decreased microglial activation and TGF\u5c3e1 levels, and prevented demyelination. On the other hand, RS-hAFSCs failed to show such neuro-protective effects. It is possible that SS-hAFSCs exert their neuroprotection via endoglin-dependent inhibition of TGF\u5c3e1 signaling in target cells. These findings identify a sub-population of CD117CD90CD105 stem cells as a promising source for the neuro-protection of the developing brain.",

Chemically induced proximity allows for precise temporal control of transcription, signaling cascades, chromatin regulation, protein folding, localization, and degradation, as well as a host of other biologic processes. A systematic analysis of CIPs in basic research, coupled with recent technological advances utilizing CRISPR, distinguishes roles of causality from coincidence and allows for mathematical modeling in synthetic biology.

Stem cell therapy has become an innovative and promising option for no-option CLI patients. As one of these promising stem cell therapies, purified CD34+ cell transplantation (PuCeT) has shown favorable short-term results. However, the long-term efficacy of PuCeT has yet to be reported. This study evaluates the long-term efficacy of PuCeT in AICLI patients. Twenty-seven AICLI patients were enrolled from May 2009 to December 2011. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and enoxaparin sodium were administered for 5 days. On day 5, CD34+ cell isolation was performed, and cells were transplanted by intramuscular injection. The primary endpoint, major-amputation-free survival rate (MAFS), as well as secondary endpoints, such as peak pain-free walking time (PPFWT) and the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale score (WFPRSS), were routinely evaluated during the 5-year follow-up period. The endpoints were as follows: the MAFS was 88.89%; PPFWT increased from 3\u9225\u58dc\u6241\u20ac? to 17\u9225\u58dc\u6241\u20ac? minutes; WFPRSS decreased from 7\u9225\u58dc\u6241\u20ac? to 0.3\u9225\u58dc\u6241\u20ac?.7; the ulcer healing rate was 85.71%; the recurrence rate was 11.11%; and SF-36v2 scores were significantly improved at 5 years after PuCeT. The rate of labor recovery 5 years after PuCeT was 65.38%, and no severe adverse effect was observed during the treatment. PuCeT demonstrated long-term efficacy and durability as a treatment of AICLI not only in achieving limb salvage but also in recovering the labor competence and improving the quality of life of patients.

In this study, the gingiva and oral mucosa and their associated stem cells were investigated. Biopsies of these tissues produce neither scarring nor functional problems and are relatively painless, and fresh tissue can be obtained readily during different chairside dental procedures. However, the embryonic origin of these cells needs to be clarified, as does their evolution from the perinatal period to adulthood. In this study, the embryonic origin of gingival fibroblasts were determined, including gingival stem cells. To do this, transgenic mouse models were used to track neural crest derivatives as well as cells derived from paraxial mesoderm, spanning from embryogenesis to adulthood. These cells were compared with ones derived from abdominal dermis and facial dermis. Our results showed that gingival fibroblasts are derived from neural crest, and that paraxial mesoderm is involved in the vasculogenesis of oral tissues during development. Our in\u807dvitro studies revealed that the neuroectodermal origin of gingival fibroblasts (or gingival stem cells) endows them with multipotential properties as well as a specific migratory and contractile phenotype which may participate to the scar-free properties of the oral mucosa. Together, these results illustrate the high regenerative potential of neural crest-derived stem cells of the oral mucosa, including the gingiva, and strongly support their use in cell therapy to regenerate tissues with impaired healing.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are widely used to treat RA patients. However, a portion of patients still have inadequate response to traditional medications. Recently, cell-based therapies have become the focus, attracting more attention due to their potential for remission induction. Several immune-regulatory cell types, such as haematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T cells have been defined as novel targets. In this paper, we have summarised and reviewed current clinical trials using cell-based therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the limited regenerative capacity of the human heart following myocardial injury, stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising approach for improving cardiac repair and function. The discovery of extracellular vesicles including exosomes as a key component of the beneficial function of stem cells has generated hope for their use to advance cell-based regenerative therapies for cardiac repair. Exosomes secreted from stem cells are membranous bionanovesicles, naturally loaded with various proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They have been found to have anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, as well as pro-angiogenic effects, all of which are crucial to restore function of the damaged myocardium. In this brief review, we will focus on the latest research and debates on cardiac repair and regenerative potential of exosomes from a variety of sources such as cardiac and non-cardiac stem and progenitor cells, somatic cells, and body fluids. We will also highlight important barriers involved in translating these findings into developing clinically suitable exosome-based therapies.",

The combination of micro and macroencapsulation approaches could provide the requirements to achieve a proper immunoisolation, while maintaining the cells localized into the body. We present the development and characterization of a porous implantable macrocapsule device for the loading of microencapsulated cells. The device was fabricated in polyamide by selective laser sintering (SLS), with controlled porosity defined by the design and the sintering conditions. Two types of microencapsulated cells were tested in order to evaluate the suitability of this device; erythropoietin (EPO) producing CC myoblasts and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) producing BHK fibroblasts. Results showed that, even if the metabolic activity of these cells decreased over time, the levels of therapeutic protein that were produced and, importantly, released to the media were stable.",

Numerous stem cell phase I/II clinical trials showing safety and efficacy will soon pursue qualifying criteria for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), aspiring to join the first stem-cell therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency. Cell based therapy requires extensive preclinical characterisation of biomarkers indicating mechanisms of action crucial to the desired therapeutic effect. Quantitative analyses monitoring critical functions for the manufacture of optimal cell and tissue-based clinical products include successful potency assays for implementation. The challenge to achieve high quality measurement is increasingly met by progress in biosensor design. We adopt a cell therapy perspective to highlight recent examples of graphene-enhanced biointerfaces for measurement of biomarkers relevant to cancer treatment, diagnosis and tissue regeneration. Graphene based biosensor design problems can thwart their use for health care transformative point of care testing and real-time applications.

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) have multipotent differentiation capacity and exist in nearly all forms of post-natal organs and tissues. The immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties of MSCs have made them an ideal candidate in the treatment of diseases, such as sepsis, in which inflammation plays a critical role. One of the key mechanisms of MSCs appears to derive from their paracrine activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are at least partially responsible for the paracrine effect. MSC-EVs transfer molecules (such as proteins/peptides, mRNA, microRNA and lipids) with immunoregulatory properties to recipient cells. MSC-EVs have been shown to mimic MSCs in alleviating sepsis and may serve as an alternative to whole cell therapy. Compared with MSCs, MSC-EVs may offer specific advantages due to lower immunogenicity and higher safety profile. The first two sections of the review discuss the preclinical and clinical findings of MSCs in sepsis. Next, we review the characteristics of EVs and MSC-EVs. Then, we summarize the mechanisms of MSC-EVs, including tissue regeneration and immunomodulation. Finally, our review presents the evidences that MSC-EVs are effective in treating models of sepsis. In conclusion, MSC-EVs may have the potential to become a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Tapping into the ability of engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to mobilise into the tumour has expanded the scope of cancer treatment. Engineered MSCs expressing tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (MSC-TRAIL) could serve as a platform for an efficient and targeted form of therapy. However, the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are resistant to TRAIL and apoptosis may represent a challenge for effective treatment. Nonetheless, with the discovery of small molecular inhibitors that could target CSCs and tumour signalling pathways, a higher efficacy of MSC-TRAIL mediated tumour inhibition can be achieved. This might pave the way for a more effective form of combined therapy, which leads to a better treatment outcome. In this review, we first discuss the tumour-homing capacity of MSCs, its effect in tumour tropism, the different approach behind genetically-engineered MSCs, and the efficacy and safety of each agent delivered by these MSCs. Then, we focus on how sensitisation of CSCs and tumours using small molecular inhibitors can increase the effect of these cells to either TRAIL or MSC-TRAIL mediated inhibition. In the conclusion, we address a few questions and safety concerns regarding the utilization of engineered MSCs for future treatment in patients.",

Initial pre-clinical and small pilot clinical studies showed promising effects of cell therapy in peripheral artery disease and chronic limb-threatening ischemia in particular.

This has led to a shift of the field towards more sophisticated cell products, especially mesenchymal stromal cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells have some important benefits, making these cells ideal for regenerative medicine, e.g., potential for allogeneic application, loss of disease-mediated cell dysfunction, reduced production costs, off-the-shelf availability.

We generated hiNSCs by a virus-free technique, whose properties recapitulate those of the clinical-grade hNSCs successfully used in an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) phase I clinical trial. Ex vivo, hiNSCs critically depend on exogenous mitogens for stable self-renewal and amplification and spontaneously differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons upon their removal. In the brain of immunodeficient mice, hiNSCs engraft and differentiate into neurons and glia, without tumour formation. These findings now warrant the establishment of clinical-grade, autologous and continuous hiNSC lines for clinical trials in neurological diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, among others.",

        "abstract": "Improved survival of extreme preterm infants has made the task of protecting the ever more immature lung from injury more challenging. As a consequence, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, has remained unchanged. The multifactorial disease pathogenesis of BPD - including amongst others inflammation, oxidative stress and excessive lung stretch - adds further complexity to finding effective therapies that would prevent lung injury and promote lung growth. Mesenchymal stromal cells and the discovery of their pleiotropic effects represent an appealing approach for the prevention of BPD. Mesenchymal stromal cells do not engraft but exert their therapeutic benefit through paracrine effects. These paracrine effects seem to be mediated through the release of nanosized extra-cellular vesicles used for cell-cell communication. This review will summarize our current knowledge on these potential nanotherapies for micropreemies.",

Given their unique functions and therapeutic use as well as the feasibility to derive macrophages in vitro from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) sources, we propose an \"easy-to-use\" immune cell spray (ICS) formulation to effectively deliver HSC-derived macrophages. To achieve this aim, we used classical pump spray devices to spray either the human myeloid cell line U937 or primary murine HSC-derived macrophages. For both cell types used, one puff could deliver cells with maintained morphology and functionality. Of note, cells tolerated the spraying process very well with a recovery of more than 90%. In addition, we used osmotic preconditioning to reduce the overall cell size of macrophages. While a 800 mosm hyperosmolar sucrose solution was able to reduce the cell size by 27%, we identified 600 mosm to be effective to reduce the cell size by 15% while maintaining macrophage morphology and functionality. Using an isolated perfused rat lung preparation, the combinatorial use of the ICS with preconditioned and genetically labeled U937 cells allowed the intra-pulmonary delivery of cells, thus paving the way for a new cell delivery platform.",

Thus endothelial progenitor cells'(EPCs) beneficial potential is particularly desirable in diabetic patients. In this review, we summarize contemporary knowledge of EPC biology in DM. It has been shown that EPC functions are considerably impaired by DM. The presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) seems to further exacerbate the deficiencies of EPCs. However, studies examining EPC counts in PAD and DM observed disparate results, which can be due to a lack of consensus on precise EPC immunotype used in the different studies. Nevertheless, the results of EPC-based autologous cell therapy (ACT) are promising. In addition, EPCs have been shown to bean independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and diabetic foot ulcer healing.",

Immunomodulatory agents, such as cytokines, can reprogram the intratumoral microenvironment; however, systemic cytokine delivery has limited access to the CNS. To bypass the limitations of systemically administered cytokines, we investigated if RNA-modified T\u807dcells could deliver macromolecules directly to brain tumors. The abilities of T\u807dcells to cross the BBB and mediate direct cytotoxic killing of intracranial tumors make them an attractive tool as biological carriers. Using T\u807dcell mRNA electroporation, we demonstrated that activated T\u807dcells can be modified to secrete granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protein while retaining their inherent effector functions in\u807dvitro. GM-CSF RNA-modified T\u807dcells effectively delivered GM-CSF to intracranial tumors in\u807dvivo and significantly extended overall survival in an orthotopic treatment model. Importantly, GM-CSF RNA-modified T\u807dcells demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy as compared to unmodified T\u807dcells alone or in combination with systemic administration of recombinant GM-CSF. Anti-tumor effects were associated with increased IFN-\u7eac secretion locally within the tumor microenvironment and systemic antigen-specific T\u807dcell expansion. These findings demonstrate that RNA-modified T\u807dcells may serve as a versatile platform for the effective delivery of biological agents to CNS tumors.",

Disease modeling and drug screening can be done in animal models, although this approach has its own limitations, since laboratory animals do not suffer from many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. The use of neurons obtained by targeted differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with known genetic mutations, as well as from carriers of sporadic forms of the disease, will allow to elucidate new components of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Such neuronal cultures can also serve as unique models for testing neuroprotective compounds and monitoring neurodegenerative changes against a background of various therapeutic interventions.

        "abstract": "Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integration site (Wnt) signaling is one of the most critical pathways in developing and adult tissues. In the brain, Wnt signaling contributes to different neurodevelopmental aspects ranging from differentiation to axonal extension, synapse formation, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. Canonical Wnt signaling is mediated mainly by the multifunctional \u5c3e-catenin protein which is a potent co-activator of transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and T-cell factor (TCF). Accumulating evidence points to dysregulation of Wnt/\u5c3e-catenin signaling in major neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights a Wnt/\u5c3e-catenin/glial connection in Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective death of midbrain dopaminergic (mDAergic) neuronal cell bodies in the subtantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and gliosis. Major findings of the last decade document that Wnt/\u5c3e-catenin signaling in partnership with glial cells is critically involved in each step and at every level in the regulation of nigrostriatal DAergic neuronal health, protection, and regeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, focusing on Wnt/\u5c3e-catenin signaling to boost a full neurorestorative program in PD.",

        "abstract": "Regenerating cardiac muscle lost during a heart attack is a topic of broad interest and enormous potential impact. One promising approach is to regenerate or re-engineer new myocardium in situ, at the site of damage, by injecting cells, growth factors, and other materials, or by reprogramming aspects of the normal wound healing process. A wide variety of strategies have been explored, from promoting angiogenesis to injection of a variety of different progenitor cell types, to re-engineering resident cells to produce key growth factors or even transdifferentiate into myocytes. Despite substantial progress and continued promise, clinical impact of this work has fallen short of expectations. One contributing factor may be that many efforts focus primarily on generating cardiomyocytes, with less attention to re-engineering the extracellular matrix (ECM). Yet the role of the ECM is particularly crucial to consider following myocardial infarction, which leads to rapid formation of a collagen-rich scar. This review combines a brief summary of current efforts to regenerate cardiomyocytes with what is currently known about the structure and mechanics of post-infarction scar, with the goal of identifying principles that can guide efforts to produce new myocytes embedded in an extracellular environment that facilitates their differentiation, maintenance, and function.",

We found that patients with T cells enriched for na\u8302ve and stem central memory cells expanded well , but the majority of tumor types showed chemotherapy-related depletion of early lineage cells with a corresponding decline in successful stimulation response. Unexpectedly, many pediatric patients with solid tumors had low numbers of na\u8302ve T cells prior to any therapy. These data indicate the manufacture of CAR T cells may need to be customized based on the nature of T cells available in each disease type. SIGNIFICANCE: Cumulative chemotherapy cycles deplete na\u8302ve T cells in many pediatric cancer regimens, reducing expansion potential associated with successful adoptive cellular therapies.

        "abstract": "Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cell is a special type of T regulatory cells with surface molecular markers such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 and CD49b. A key property of Tr1 cells is the capability to produce high-level interleukin 10 (IL-10) upon activation, in a FOXP3-independent manner. The immunosuppressive function of IL-10 producing Tr1 cells has been extensively studied for many years. Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are conditions in which the immune system breaks down and starts to attack the body. AIDs include inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus, Greaves' disease, and so forth. In recent years, more and more studies have documented that the number of Tr1 cells is decreased and the function is inhibited in a variety of AIDs, among which MS is the most widely studied. The protocol for engineering Tr1 cell therapy has been established and is gradually being used in clinical practice in recent years. Tr1 cell therapy has been proven to be safe and effective, but it is mainly involved in myeloid leukemia, graft versus host disease currently. Its therapeutic role in AIDs still needs to be further explored. In this study, we will summarize the research advances of Tr1 cells in AIDs, which will provide useful information for treating AIDs through Tr1 cell therapy in the future.",

Although many studies have investigated on the efficacy of MSCs in AD, how MSCs actually change following exposure to the AD environment has not been studied extensively. In this study, we investigated on the potential of AD patient-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to be used as a formulation of MSCs and its application in AD therapeutics. When Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) were stored in the CSF of AD patients, the stemness of WJ-MSCs was preserved. Furthermore, several genes were upregulated following storage in AD CSF. This signified the therapeutic potential of CSF formulation for AD therapy. Overall, these findings suggest that CSF from AD patients can be an optimal source for MSC formulation.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a global challenge and, despite the availability of dialysis and transplantation, can be fatal. Those that survive an AKI are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the pathophysiology of AKI is critical for developing novel strategies for diagnosis and treatment. A growing body of evidence indicates that amplifying type 2 immunity may have therapeutic potential in kidney injury and disease. Of particular interest are the recently described subset of innate immune cells, termed group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Group 2 ILCs are crucial tissue-resident immune cells that maintain homeostasis and regulate tissue repair at multiple organ sites, including the kidney. They are critical mediators of type 2 immune responses following infection and injury. The existing literature suggests that activation of group 2 ILCs and production of a local type 2 immune milieu is protective against renal injury and associated pathology. In this review, we describe the emerging role for group 2 ILCs in renal homeostasis and repair. We provide an in-depth discussion of the most recent literature that use preclinical models of AKI and assess the therapeutic effect of modulating group 2 ILC function. We debate the potential for targeting these cells as novel cellular therapies in AKI and discuss the implications for future studies and translation.

        "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world with a high annual incidence level. Researchers have been working on developing treatments for cancer. Targeted therapy is an emerging treatment modality that is more novel than surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In targeted therapy, exogenous nanoscale microparticles are applied as carriers for drugs or genes. However, conventional particles have certain limitations attributed to non-specific cytotoxicity, biocompatibility and low delivery efficacy in individual therapeutic vector systems. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by various cells that consist of lipid bilayer membranes without organelles. Due to their excellent biocompatibility, exosomes have received increased attention in recent years for targeted therapy applications. This review briefly introduces the current status of targeted therapy, and exosomes are introduced by their structural characteristics, physiological effects and separation methods. This review also discusses the applications of engineered exosomes derived from different cells in the field of targeted therapies and compares the two-way regulation of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes in tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "T lymphocytes play a critical role in the pro-inflammatory anti-cancer response; hence, significant pharmacologic efforts have been made to enhance the endogenous T cell response. Unfortunately, significant toxicity arises consequent to pan T cell activation. In contrast, the less robust T cell alloresponse has also demonstrated an anti-cancer effect, but poses an inherent risk of GvHD. To overcome the GvHD risk, an acellular pro-inflammatory agent (IA1) has been biomanufactured from the secretome of the allorecognition response. To assess IA1's immunomodulatory activity, T cell proliferation and differentiation were determined in vitro. The pro-inflammatory properties of the IA1 therapeutic were mediated by the miRNA-enriched fractions. Moreover, cross-species efficacy was observed consequent to the evolutionary conservation of miRNA. IA1 exerted no toxicity to resting PBMC but induced significant proliferation of resting CD3 (CD4 and CD8) T cells and skewed the response towards a pro-inflammatory state (i.e., increased Teff:Treg ratio). Crucially, IA1-activated PBMC demonstrated a potent inhibition of cancer cell (HeLa and SH-4 melanoma) proliferation relative to the resting PBMC. The anti-proliferation effect of IA1-activated PBMC was noted within \u85f412\u9225\u5870 versus 4-5 days for resting cells. A second biomanufactured therapeutic (IA2; produced using HeLa cells) surprisingly demonstrated direct toxicity to cancer cells but was less effective than IA1 in inducing a cell-mediated response. This study demonstrates that miRNA-enriched therapeutics can be biomanufactured from the secretome and can induce a potent pro-inflammatory, anti-cancer, effect on resting lymphocytes.",

Current therapies for IDD include conservative and invasive approaches, but none of those treatments are able to restore the disc structure and function. Recently, tissue engineering techniques emerged as a possible approach to treat IDD, by replacing a damaged IVD with scaffolds and appropriate cells. Advances in manufacturing techniques, material processing and development, surface functionalization, drug delivery systems and cell incorporation furthered the development of tissue engineering therapies. In this review, biomaterial scaffolds and cell-based therapies for IVD regeneration are briefly discussed.",

Microglia, the resident macrophage cells of the brain, have also emerged as key players in neuroinflammation. As primary human microglia from living subjects are normally not accessible to researchers, there is a pressing need for an alternative source of authentic human microglia which allows modeling of neurodegeneration in vitro. Several protocols for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia have recently been developed and provide unlimited access to patient-derived material. In this present study, we give an overview of iPSC-derived microglia models in monoculture and coculture systems, their advantages and limitations, and how they have already been used for disease phenotyping. Furthermore, we outline some of the gene engineering tools to generate isogenic controls, the creation of gene knockout iPSC lines, as well as covering reporter cell lines, which could help to elucidate complex cell interaction mechanisms in the microglia/neuron coculture system, for example, microglia-induced synapse loss. Finally, we deliberate on how said cocultures could aid in personalized drug screening to identify patient-specific therapies against neurodegeneration. Stem Cells 2019;37:724-730.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in western countries with more than 100,000 new cases per year in Europe and a mortality rate higher than 90%. In this scenario, advanced therapies based on gene therapies are emerging, thanks to a better understanding of tumour architecture and cancer cell alterations. We have demonstrated the efficacy of an innovative approach for pancreatic cancer based on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) genetically engineered to produce TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). Here we investigated the combination of this MSC-based approach with the administration of a paclitaxel (PTX)-based chemotherapy to improve the potential of the treatment, also accounting for a possible resistance onset. Starting from the BXPC3 cell line, we generated and profiled a TRAIL-resistant model of pancreatic cancer, testing the impact of the combined treatment with specific cytotoxicity and metabolic assays. We then challenged the rationale in a subcutaneous mouse model of pancreatic cancer, assessing its effect on tumour size accounting stromal and parenchymal organization. PTX was able to restore pancreatic cancer sensitivity to MSC-delivered TRAIL by reverting its pro-survival gene expression profile. The two compounds cooperate both and and the combined treatment resulted in an improved cytotoxicity on tumour cells. In summary, this study uncovers the potential of a combinatory approach between MSC-delivered TRAIL and PTX, supporting the combination of cell-based products and conventional chemotherapeutics as a tool to improve the efficacy of the treatments, also addressing possible mechanisms of resistance.",

        "abstract": "Adoptive T\u807dcell therapy is a form of cellular therapy that utilizes human immune cells, often empowered by the expression of recombinant proteins, to attack selected targets present on tumor or infected cells. T\u807dcell-based immunotherapy has been progressing over the past several decades, and reached a milestone with the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of chimeric antigen receptor T\u807dcell therapy for relapsed and refractory leukemia and lymphoma. Although most studies have used viral vectors, a growing number of researchers have come to appreciate in\u807dvitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA for the development, testing, and application of T\u807dcell-based immunotherapeutics. IVT mRNA offers inherent safety features, highly efficient recombinant protein translation, and the ability to control pharmacokinetic properties of the therapy. In this review, we discuss the history of IVT mRNA in adoptive T\u807dcell therapy, from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T\u807dcell receptor-based therapies to chimeric antigen receptor therapy and gene-editing techniques, as well as prior and ongoing clinical trials.",

Cell therapies have played a substantial part in this progress. Cellular immunotherapies can use immune cells, such as T cells or natural killer cells that, after functional modification ex vivo, exert powerful anti-cancer effects when given to the patient. Innovative technologies, such as re-programming terminally differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells or into other cell types and applying specific enzymes to more precisely edit the human genome, are paving the way towards more potent cell and gene therapies.Mesenchymal stromal cells are promising cellular immunotherapeutics, which also have potential for use in tissue engineering strategies and other regenerative medicine applications. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge of their biology and therapeutic efficacy present major challenges to their sustainable implementation in the clinical routine.In this article, progress in the field of cell therapeutics during the past 15 years will be briefly discussed, with a focus on mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting the impact of this field on patient care.",

Herein, we critically summarize the fundamentals of hydrogels based on their equilibrium and dynamics of their molecular structure, as well as solute diffusion as it relates to drug delivery. In addition, examples of common microgel synthesis techniques are provided. The ability to tune microscale hydrogels to obtain controlled release of therapeutics is discussed, along with microgel considerations for cell encapsulation as it relates to the development of cell-based therapies.

        "abstract": "Inflammation is a central feature and is implicated as a causal factor in preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Inflammatory mediators and leukocytes, which are elevated in peripheral blood and gestational tissues, contribute to the uterine vascular anomalies and compromised placental function that characterize particularly the severe, early onset form of disease. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are central mediators of pregnancy tolerance and direct other immune cells to counteract inflammation and promote robust placentation. Treg cells are commonly perturbed in preeclampsia, and there is evidence Treg cell insufficiency predates onset of symptoms. A causal role is implied by mouse studies showing sufficient numbers of functionally competent Treg cells must be present in the uterus from conception, to support maternal vascular adaptation and prevent later placental inflammatory pathology. Treg cells may therefore provide a tractable target for both preventative strategies and treatment interventions in preeclampsia. Steps to boost Treg cell activity require investigation and could be incorporated into pregnancy planning and preconception care. Pharmacological interventions developed to target Treg cells in autoimmune conditions warrant consideration for evaluation, utilizing rigorous clinical trial methodology, and ensuring safety is paramount. Emerging cell therapy tools involving Treg cell generation and/or expansion may in time become relevant. The success of preventative and therapeutic approaches will depend on resolving several challenges including developing informative diagnostic tests for Treg cell activity applicable before conception or during early pregnancy, selection of relevant patient subgroups, and identification of appropriate windows of gestation for intervention.",

This study focuses on comparison of cells and connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) derived from native human infrapatellar fatpad (IPFP), synovium (SYN), and periosteum (PERI). : IPFP, SYN, PERI were harvested from twenty-eight patients undergoing arthroplasty. CTPs were quantitatively characterized using automated colony-forming-unit assay to compare total nucleated cell concentration-[Cell], cells/mg; prevalence-(P), CTPs/million nucleated cells; CTP concentration-[CTP], CTPs/mg; proliferation and differentiation potential; and correlate outcomes with patient's age and gender. : [Cell] did not differ between IPFP, SYN, and PERI. P was influenced by age and gender: patients >60\u807dyears, IPFP and SYN had higher P than PERI ( <\u807d0.001) and females had higher P in IPFP ( <\u807d0.001) and SYN ( =\u807d0.001) than PERI. [CTP] was influenced by age: patients <50\u807dyears, SYN ( =\u807d0.0165) and PERI ( <\u807d0.001) had higher [CTP] than IPFP; patients between 60 and 69\u807dyears, SYN ( <\u807d0.001) had higher [CTP] than PERI; patients >70\u807dyears, IPFP ( =\u807d0.006) had higher [CTP] than PERI. In patients >60\u807dyears, proliferation potential of CTPs differed significantly (SYN>IPFP>PERI); however, differentiation potentials were comparable between all three tissue sources. : SYN and IPFP may serve as a preferred tissue source for patients >60\u807dyears, and PERI along with SYN and IPFP may serve as a preferred tissue source for patients <60\u807dyears for cartilage repair. However, the heterogeneity among the CTPs in any given tissue source suggests performance-based selection might be useful to optimize cell-sourcing strategies to improve efficacy of cellular therapies for cartilage repair.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 466 million people suffer from hearing loss worldwide. Sensorineural hearing loss is characterized by degeneration of key structures of the sensory pathway in the cochlea such as the sensory hair cells, the primary auditory neurons and their synaptic connection to the hair cells - the ribbon synapse. Various strategies to protect or regenerate these sensory cells and structures are the subject of intensive research. Yet despite recent advances in our understandings of the capacity of the cochlea for repair and regeneration there are currently no pharmacological or biological interventions for hearing loss. Current research focusses on localized cochlear drug, gene and cell-based therapies. One of the more promising drug-based therapies is based on neurotrophic factors for the repair of the ribbon synapse after noise exposure, as well as preventing loss of primary auditory neurons and regrowth of the auditory neuron fibers after severe hearing loss. Drug therapy delivery technologies are being employed to address the specific needs of neurotrophin and other therapies for hearing loss that include the need for high doses, long-term delivery, localised or cell-specific targeting and techniques for their safe and efficacious delivery to the cochlea. Novel biomaterials are enabling high payloads of drugs to be administered to the cochlea with subsequent slow-release properties that are proving to be beneficial for treating hearing loss. In parallel, new gene therapy technologies are addressing the need for cell specificity and high efficacy for the treatment of both genetic and acquired hearing loss with promising reports of hearing recovery. Some biomaterials and cell therapies are being used in conjunction with the cochlear implant ensuring therapeutic benefit to the primary neurons during electrical stimulation. This review will introduce the auditory system, hearing loss and the potential for repair and regeneration in the cochlea. Drug delivery to the cochlea will then be reviewed, with a focus on new biomaterials, gene therapy technologies, cell therapy and the use of the cochlear implant as a vehicle for drug delivery. With the current pre-clinical research effort into therapies for hearing loss, including clinical trials for gene therapy, the future for the treatment for hearing loss is looking bright.",

        "abstract": "Myeloid-differentiated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have contributed to a number of novel treatment approaches for lysosomal storage diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and may also be applied to patients infected with HIV. We quantified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) trafficking to 20 tissues including lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, CNS, and reproductive tissues. We observed efficient marking of multiple macrophage subsets, including CNS-associated myeloid cells, suggesting that HSPC-derived macrophages are a viable approach to target gene-modified cells to tissues. Gene-marked cells in the CNS were unique from gene-marked cells at any other physiological sites including peripheral blood. This novel finding suggests that these cells were derived from HSPCs, migrated to the brain, were compartmentalized, established myeloid progeny, and could be targeted for lifelong delivery of therapeutic molecules. Our findings have highly relevant implications for the development of novel therapies for genetic and infectious diseases of the CNS.",

        "abstract": "Tendon injuries, as one of the most common orthopedic disorders, are the major cause of early retirement or wastage among sport horses which mainly affect the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT). Tendon repair is a slow process, and tendon tissue is often replaced by scar tissue. The current treatment options are often followed by an incomplete recovery that increases the susceptibility to re-injury. Recently, cell therapy has been used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon injuries, although the risk of ectopic bone formation after cell injection is possible in some cases. In vitro tenogenic induction may overcome the mentioned risk in clinical application. Moreover, a better understanding of treatment strategies for musculoskeletal injuries in horse may have future applications for human and vice versa. This comprehensive review outlines the current strategies of stem cell therapy in equine tendon injury and in vitro tenogenic induction of equine stem cell.",

Despite significant advances in radiation techniques, radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) still occurs in up to 30% of patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy, and therefore remains the main dose-limiting obstacle. RILI is a potentially lethal clinical complication of radiotherapy that has 2 main stages: an acute stage defined as radiation pneumonitis, and a late stage defined as radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Patients who develop lung fibrosis have a reduced quality of life with progressive and irreversible organ malfunction. Currently, the most effective intervention for the treatment of lung fibrosis is lung transplantation, but the lack of available lungs and transplantation-related complications severely limits the success of this procedure. Over the last few decades, advances have been reported in the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for lung tissue repair and regeneration. MSCs not only replace damaged lung epithelial cells but also promote tissue repair through the secretion of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic factors. Here, we present an overview of MSC-based therapy for radiation-induced lung fibrosis, focusing in particular on the molecular mechanisms involved and describing the most recent preclinical and clinical studies carried out in the field.",

Individualized immunotherapy, enabled by the identification of patient-specific mutations, neoantigens and biomarkers, and facilitated by advances in genomics and proteomics, promises to broaden the responder patient population. In this Perspective, we give an overview of immunotherapies leveraging engineering approaches, including the design of biomaterials, delivery strategies and nanotechnology solutions, for the realization of individualized cancer treatments such as nanoparticle vaccines customized with neoantigens, cell therapies based on patient-derived dendritic cells and T cells, and combinations of theranostic strategies.

        "abstract": "Preclinical animal models allow to study development and progression of several diseases, including liver disorders. These studies, for ethical reasons and medical limits, are impossible to carry out in human patients. At the same time, such experimental models constitute an important source of knowledge on pathomechanisms for drug- and virus-induced hepatotoxicity, both acute and chronic. Carbon tetrachloride, D-Galactosamine, and retrorsine are xenobiotics that can be used in immunocompetent animal models of hepatotoxicity, where chemical-intoxicated livers present histological features representative of human viruses-related infection. A prolonged derangement into liver architecture and functions commonly lead to cirrhosis, eventually resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma. In human, orthotopic liver transplantation commonly resolve most the problems related to cirrhosis. However, the shortage of donors does not allow all the patients in the waiting list to receive an organ on time. A promising alternative treatment for acute and chronic liver disease has been advised in liver cell transplantation, but the limited availability of hepatocytes for clinical approaches, in addition to the immunosuppressant regiment required to sustain cellular long-term engraftment have been encouraging the use of alternative cell sources. A recent effective source of stem cells have been recently identified in the human amnion membrane. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) have been preclinically tested and proven sufficient to rescue immunocompetent rodents lethally intoxicated with drugs. The adoption of therapeutic procedures based on hAEC transplant in immunocompetent recipients affected by liver diseases, as well as patients with immune-related disorders, may constitute a successful new alternative therapy in regenerative medicine.",

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in the regeneration of the liver. The objective of the study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of HGF-transfected human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. HGF-transfected MSCs were transplanted into rats with DMN-induced liver fibrosis. HO-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species were reduced in HGF-transfected MSCs in HGF-transfected MSCs. Pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase-3, were decreased in HGF-transfected MSCs. Biochemical analysis showed that the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were decreased after transplantation of HGF-transfected MSCs in rat fibrosis. Trichrome staining showed that HGF-transfected MSCs reduced liver damage. Taken together, our study indicated that HGF-transfected MSCs have therapeutic effects on DMN-induced liver fibrosis in rats.",

In the current study, we attempted to differentiate these established E-iPSCs into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by serial passaging using MSC-defined media for stem cell expansion. Differentiation of the MSCs was confirmed by analyzing expression levels of the MSC surface markers CD44 and CD29, and the pluripotency markers Nanog and Oct4. Results indicated that the E-iPSC-derived MSCs (E-iPSC-MSCs) retained the characteristics of MSCs, including the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic, osteogenic, or myogenic lineages. E-iPSC-MSCs were rendered suitable for therapeutic use by inhibiting immune rejection through exposure to transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-\u5c3e2) in culture, which down-regulated the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) proteins that cause immune rejection if they are incompatible with the MHC antigen of the recipient. We reported 16 cases of E-iPSC-MSC transplantations into injured horses with generally positive effects, such as reduced lameness and fraction lines. Our findings indicate that E-iPSC-MSCs can demonstrate MSC characteristics and be safely and practically used in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in horses.",
